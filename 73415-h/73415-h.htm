<h2 class="nobreak lsp2" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="r10">

<p class="p2 noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the
noble deeds with which the Military History of our
country abounds. To hold forth these bright examples
to the imitation of the youthful soldier, and
thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct
of those who have preceded him in their honorable
career, are among the motives that have given rise
to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iva"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting
under their orders, expressions of approbation and
of thanks for their skill and bravery; and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their
Sovereign’s approbation, constitute the reward
which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_va"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, been undisturbed by the <i>presence of
war</i>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,—on
their sufferings,—and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the Official Reports made by the respective
Commanders, ample justice has generally been done
to the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_via"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General’s
Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i>Esprit
de Corps</i>—an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,—victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viia"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow-citizens in arms,—a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,—will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<span class="fs120 lsp2">THE INFANTRY.</span></h2>


<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xa"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse:
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xia"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i>arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<i>men-at-arms</i>,” and sixty “<i>shot</i>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiia"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was; the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers; half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of
companies into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men; but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <i>musketeers</i>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiiia"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <i>pikemen</i>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of Pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiva"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted
about twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery
was first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xva"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War.
Since that period the arms of the infantry soldier
have been limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops
have seldom differed materially, since the Conquest,
from those of other European states; and in some
respects the arming has, at certain periods, been
allowed to be inferior to that of the nations with
whom they have had to contend; yet, under this
disadvantage, the bravery and superiority of the
British infantry have been evinced on very many
and most trying occasions, and splendid victories
have been gained over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a rate of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <i>Crecy</i>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:—the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated at <i>Poictiers</i>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvia"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <i>Agincourt</i>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviia"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <i>Invincible</i>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,—intrepidity which no danger
can appal,—unconquerable spirit and resolution,—patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,—have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviiia"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xixa"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i>arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to ensure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have
the welfare of their country at heart, the records
of the several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> The 30th, 31st, and 32nd Regiments were formed as Marine corps
in 1702, and were employed as such during the wars in the reign of
Queen Anne. The Marine corps were embarked in the Fleet under
Admiral Sir George Rooke, and were at the taking of Gibraltar, and
in its subsequent defence in 1704; they were afterwards employed at
the siege of Barcelona in 1705.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> “Under the blessing of Divine Providence, His Majesty ascribes
the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in Egypt to
that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but His Majesty
desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed on the consideration
of every part of the army, that it has been a strict observance of
order, discipline, and military system, which has given the full energy
to the native valour of the troops, and has enabled them proudly to
assert the superiority of the national military character, in situations
uncommonly arduous, and under circumstances of peculiar difficulty.”—<i>General
Orders in 1801.</i></p>

<p>In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope
(afterwards Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the successful
result of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January 1809,
it is stated:—“On no occasion has the undaunted valour of British
troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a severe and
harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority which the enemy
had acquired, and which had materially impaired the efficiency of the
troops, many disadvantages were to be encountered. These have all
been surmounted by the conduct of the troops themselves: and the
enemy has been taught, that whatever advantages of position or of
numbers he may possess, there is inherent in the British officers and
soldiers a bravery that knows not how to yield,—that no circumstances
can appal,—and that will ensure victory, when it is to be obtained by
the exertion of any human means.”</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The disturbed state of affairs on the continent of
Europe in 1793, particularly in France, arising from
the principles of the Revolution in that country, which
threatened surrounding nations with universal anarchy,
occasioned preparations to be made throughout the
several countries, in order to oppose the dangerous
doctrines which were then diffused under the specious
terms of “Liberty and Equality.”</p>

<p>On the 1st of February 1793, the National Convention
of France, after the decapitation of King
Louis XVI. on the 21st of the previous month, declared
war against Great Britain and Holland. Augmentations
were immediately made to the regular army,
the militia was embodied, and the British people
evinced their loyalty and patriotism by forming volunteer
associations, and by making every exertion for
the maintenance of monarchical principles, and for the
defence of those institutions which had raised their
country to a high position among the nations of Europe.</p>

<p>Upwards of fifty regiments of infantry were authorised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
to be raised, on this emergency, in the several
parts of Great Britain and Ireland, by officers and
gentlemen possessing local influence, sixteen of which
regiments, viz. from the Seventy-eighth to the Ninety-third,
continue at this period on the establishment of
the army.</p>

<p>Of the officers thus honored with the confidence of
their Sovereign and his Government, Lieut.-Colonel John
Doyle (afterwards General Sir John Doyle, Bart., and
G.C.B.) was selected, to whom a letter of service
was addressed on the 18th of September 1793, authorising
him to raise a regiment, to consist of ten
companies of sixty rank and file in each company. The
corps was speedily completed, and was designated the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, or <span class="smcap">The Prince of Wales’s Irish
Regiment</span>.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the <i>Letter of Service</i>,
addressed by the Secretary-at-War to Major John
Doyle, on the half-pay of the late One hundred and
fifth regiment, dated</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 4.5em;">“<i>War Office,</i></span><br>
“<i>18th September 1793.</i></p>

<div class="smcap">“Sir,</div>

<p>“I am commanded to acquaint you, that His Majesty
approves of your raising a regiment of foot,
without any allowance of levy money, to be completed
within three months, upon the following
terms, viz.:</p>

<p>“The corps is to consist of one company of Grenadiers,
one of Light Infantry, and eight battalion companies.
The Grenadier company is to consist of one captain,
two lieutenants, three serjeants, three corporals, two
drummers, two fifers, and fifty-seven private men.
The Light Infantry company of one captain, two
lieutenants, three serjeants, three corporals, two
drummers, and fifty-seven men; and each battalion
company of one captain, one lieutenant, and one
ensign, three serjeants, three corporals, two drummers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
and fifty-seven private men, together with the usual
staff officers, and with a serjeant-major and quartermaster-serjeant,
exclusive of the serjeants above
specified. The captain-lieutenant is (as usual) included
in the number of lieutenants above mentioned.</p>

<p>“The corps is to have one major with a company, and
is to be under your command as major, with a company.</p>

<p>“The pay of the officers is to commence from the
dates of their commissions, and that of the non-commissioned
officers and privates from the dates of
their attestations.</p>

<p>“His Majesty is pleased to leave to you the nomination
of the officers of the regiment; but the lieut.-colonel
and major are to be taken from the list of
lieut.-colonels or majors on half-pay, or the major
from a captain on full pay. Six of the captains
are to be taken from the half-pay, and the other
captain and the captain-lieutenant from the list
of captains or captain-lieutenants on full pay. All
the lieutenants are to be taken from the half-pay;
and the gentlemen recommended for ensigns are not
to be under sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>“No officer, however, is to be taken from the half-pay
who received the difference on going upon the
half-pay, nor is any officer coming from the half-pay
to contribute any money towards the levy, but he may
be required to raise such a quota of men as you
may agree upon with him.</p>

<p>“The person to be recommended for quartermaster
must not be proposed for any other commission.</p>

<p>“In case the corps should be reduced after it has
been once established, the officers will be entitled to
half-pay.</p>

<p>“No man is to be enlisted above thirty-five years
of age, nor under five feet five inches high. Well-made,
growing lads, between sixteen and eighteen
years of age, may be taken at five feet four inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>“The recruits are to be engaged without limitation
as to the period or place of their service.</p>

<p>“The non-commissioned officers and privates are to
be inspected by a general officer, who will reject all
such as are unfit for service, or not enlisted in conformity
to the terms of this letter.</p>

<p>“In the execution of this service, I take leave to
assure you of every assistance which my office can
afford.</p>

<p class="p1">The effective numbers were quickly recruited, and
the regiment was so far formed as to be considered fit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
to be employed on active continental service. It was
consequently embarked in the summer of 1794, as part
of a force under Major-General the Earl Moira,
and was sent to join the British army in Flanders,
under the command of His Royal Highness the Duke
of York. While on the march the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment was attacked on the 15th of July 1794, at
the outpost of <i>Alost</i>, by a strong corps of the enemy’s
cavalry, which it repulsed, and for which act of bravery
it received the thanks of the general officer in public
orders. It is a circumstance worthy of being recorded
in the regimental history, that the first individual of the
regiment who was wounded, was the Lieut.-Colonel
by whom it was raised. In the general orders of the
Earl of Moira upon this occasion, “he expressed his
admiration of the cool intrepidity with which the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment repulsed an attack from
the enemy’s cavalry, at the bridge of Alost, where
its commander, Lieut.-Colonel Doyle, received two
severe wounds, but would not quit his regiment,
until the enemy had given up the attack.” The
Duke of York, in his public letter, thus mentioned
the affair:—</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">“<i>Head-quarters, Cortyke,</i></span><br>
“<i>15th July 1794.</i><br>
</p>

<p>“Lord Moira speaks highly of the conduct of the
officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment
on this occasion, particularly of Lieut.-Colonel Doyle,
commanding the corps, who was severely wounded.</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “<span class="smcap">Frederick</span>.”</p>
    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1795.</div>

<p>In 1795 the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment was sent
into Bergen-op-Zoom to be drilled; but soon after its
arrival, the Dutch garrison revolted against the government,
opened the gates, and joined the French, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
entered with twenty thousand men, and made a capitulation
with the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, the only British
corps in the town, then commanded by Lord Dungarvan
(afterwards Earl of Cork), Lieut.-Colonel
Doyle having been sent to England for the recovery of
his wounds. The capitulation was however broken by
the French, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> were marched
prisoners of war into France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796.</div>

<p>The regiment was again filled up, and, with the Tenth
foot, and some marines, was sent upon a secret expedition
to the North Sea, under the command of Brigadier-General
John Doyle, who had been promoted
Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, on the 3rd of May
1796, to co-operate with Admiral (the late Lord) Duncan;
but, having been delayed in England until the end
of September, the tempestuous weather, usual at that
season of the year in those seas, dispersed the ships and
small craft by which the troops were to be landed, and
put an end to the object of the expedition. The troops
returned to England in the ships of war, in which they
embarked under the orders of Admiral Sir Richard
Bickerton.</p>

<p>On the 14th of October 1796, the regiment embarked
for the West Indies.</p>

<p>Spain having united with France in hostility to Great
Britain, an expedition under Lieut.-General Sir Ralph
Abercromby, K.B., proceeded against the Spanish
island of <i>Trinidad</i>, which capitulated on the 18th of
February 1797. No men were killed or wounded.
Lieutenant R—— Villeneuve, of the Eighth foot,
major of brigade to Brigadier-General Hompesch, was
the only officer wounded, and he died of his wounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797.</div>

<p>After the reduction of Trinidad, the force (of which
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> formed part) destined for the expedition
against <i>Porto Rico</i>, being assembled, the fleet
sailed from Martinique on the 8th of April 1797, and
on the 10th arrived at St. Kitt’s, where it remained for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
a few days. On the 17th the fleet anchored off Congrejos
Point, and a landing was effected on the island
of Porto Rico on the following day. The troops advanced,
when it was perceived that the only point on
which the town could be attacked was on the eastern
side, where it was defended by the Castle and Lines of
St. Christopher, to approach which it was necessary to
force a way over the lagoon which formed that side of
the island. This passage was strongly defended by two
redoubts and gun-boats, and the enemy had destroyed the
bridge connecting, in the narrowest channel, the island
with the main land. After every effort the British
could never sufficiently silence the fire of the enemy, who
was likewise entrenched in the rear of these redoubts,
to hazard forcing the passage with so small a number of
troops. It was next endeavoured to bombard the town
from a point to the southward of it, near to a large magazine
abandoned by the enemy. This was tried for several
days without any great effect, on account of the distance.
Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, seeing that no
act of vigour, or any combined operation between the
sea and land services, could in any manner avail, determined
to re-embark the troops, which was effected during
the night of the 30th of April. Four Spanish field-pieces
were brought off, but not a sick or wounded
soldier was left behind, and nothing of any value fell
into the hands of the enemy. Sir Ralph Abercromby
in his despatch alluded to the troops in the following
terms: “The behaviour of the troops has been meritorious;
they were patient under labour, regular and
orderly in their conduct, and spirited when an opportunity
to show it occurred.” The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
had two rank and file killed, three wounded, and thirteen
missing.</p>

<p>The regiment subsequently proceeded to St. Lucia,
which had been captured from the French in May
1796.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1798.</div>

<p>During the year 1798, the regiment remained at St.
Lucia.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1799.</div>

<p>In December 1799, the regiment proceeded from St.
Lucia to Martinique.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1800.</div>

<p>The regiment was removed, in April 1800, from Martinique
to Dominica.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1801.</div>

<p>In April 1801 the regiment embarked from Dominica
for Barbadoes, and in August following proceeded to
Curaçoa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802.</div>

<p>The preliminaries of peace, which had been agreed
upon between Great Britain and France in the previous
year, were ratified on the 27th of March 1802; but
the peace which had been thus concluded was but of
short duration. Napoleon Bonaparte, who had been
elected First Consul of the French Republic, showed,
on several occasions, that he continued to entertain
strong feelings of hostility against Great Britain.</p>

<p>During the year 1802, the regiment continued to be
stationed at Curaçoa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803.</div>

<p>After a few months, during which further provocations
took place between the two countries, war was
declared against France on the 18th of May 1803.
The preparations which had been making in the
French ports, the assembling of large bodies of troops
on the coast, and the forming of numerous flotillas
of gun-boats, justified the British government in adopting
the strongest measures of defence, and in calling
upon the people for their aid and services. Numerous
volunteer associations were formed in all parts of the
kingdom in defence of the Sovereign, the laws, and
the institutions of the country. The militia was re-embodied,
and the regular army was considerably
augmented, under the “<i>Army of Reserve Act</i>,” as shown
in the Appendix, page 97.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment embarked from the
island of Curaçoa for England on the 12th of January
1803, on board of the ship “De Ruyter,” which,
meeting with tempestuous weather, was obliged to put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
into Jamaica, from whence it proceeded to Antigua,
where it arrived in April 1803. The regiment proceeded
to St. Kitt’s in June following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804.</div>

<p>On the 28th of July 1804 the regiment embarked
from St. Kitt’s, and on the 28th of September following
it landed at Plymouth, after a service of eight years in
the West Indies, having lost during that period, by the
diseases incident to the climate, many officers, and
between seven and eight hundred men.</p>

<p>On the 31st of October the regiment embarked, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel Sir Edward Butler, from
Plymouth, for Guernsey, of which island Major-General
Doyle had been appointed to the command and to
the Lieutenant-Governorship.</p>

<p>The British Government, having ascertained that the
King of Spain had engaged to furnish powerful aid to
France, felt itself compelled to consider Spain as an
enemy, and accordingly issued orders for intercepting
some frigates off Cadiz, which were on their way to
France with cargoes of treasure: a declaration of war
was consequently issued by the Court of Madrid against
Great Britain on the 12th of December 1804.</p>

<p>The establishment of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment,
which had been authorised to receive men raised in certain
counties of Ireland, under the Act of Parliament,
dated 14th July 1804, termed the “<i>Additional Force
Act</i>,” was augmented by a second battalion, of which a
distinct account is commenced at page 41.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1805.</div>

<p>On the 10th of March 1805, a detachment, consisting
of twenty-eight serjeants, fifteen drummers, and five
hundred and twenty-eight rank and file, being drafts
from the levy then raising in the county of Mayo by
the Honorable H. E. Browne, embarked from Ireland
for Guernsey, and joined the first battalion on the 15th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
of April following, thus considerably augmenting the
effective strength of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806.</div>

<p>On the 2nd of November 1805, the first battalion
embarked from Guernsey, and proceeded to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment
embarked at Portsmouth on the 23rd of July 1806, and
proceeded to Plymouth, where it disembarked on the
6th of September following. On the 12th of that month
it embarked for South America, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Sir Edward Butler; the effective numbers
were, fifty-three serjeants, eighteen drummers, and
eight hundred and five rank and file.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>

<p>The first battalion arrived in the Rio de la Plata in
January 1807, and disembarked on the 16th of that
month near <i>Monte Video</i>, where it took up a position in
advance, protecting the breaching batteries, it having
been arranged between Brigadier-General Sir Samuel
Auchmuty and Rear-Admiral Stirling to lay siege to
the place. The piquets of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
under Major Miller, were attacked by the Spaniards,
who were defeated with great loss. On the 3rd of
February, a practicable breach being made, the troops
proceeded to storm the town, which was carried, and
the citadel soon afterwards surrendered.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, under Lieut.-Colonel Sir
Edward Butler, had three officers and sixty men killed,
and three officers and eighty men wounded: total, one
hundred and forty-six; strength in the field, seven
hundred and eighty-eight.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> subsequently received the
royal authority to bear the words “<span class="smcap">Monte Video</span>” on
the regimental colour and appointments in commemoration
of the gallantry evinced in the capture of that
place on the 3rd of February 1807.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May, Lieut.-General Whitelocke having
arrived from England with reinforcements, proceeded as
Commander-in-chief to prepare for the attack of Buenos
Ayres. In a brilliant affair at Colonia on the 7th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
June, the light company of the battalion was creditably
engaged. On the 18th of June the troops embarked at
Monte Video, and on the 28th of the same month landed
at <i>Ensenada da Barragon</i>, about twenty-eight miles from
Buenos Ayres, without firing a shot. Major-General
John Levison Gower was the second in command to
Lieut.-General Whitelocke, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
were posted in the right brigade under Brigadier-General
Sir Samuel Auchmuty.</p>

<p>In the assault of <i>Buenos Ayres</i> on the morning of the
5th of July 1807, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> were formed
by wings, the right commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Sir
Edward Butler, and the left by Major Miller. The
orders were to pierce by the two streets to the right of
the Retiro, in performing which (in company with the
Thirty-eighth regiment) they suffered very severely.
In the course of this service, Lieutenant William Hutchinson,
in command of Captain Frederick Desbarres’s
company, took two of the enemy’s guns, turned them
on the Plazo del Toro, and, after a few rounds, the
enemy, to the number of fifteen hundred, surrendered to
him. The thanks of Sir Samuel Auchmuty were given
to Lieutenant Hutchinson for his gallant conduct upon
this occasion. Serjeant Byrne also distinguished himself
by his bravery. Twenty-nine pieces of artillery,
with a quantity of military stores, were taken. The
light company, which was detached from the regiment,
was taken prisoners in the convent of St. Domingo,
and remained for three days, when it was restored agreeably
to the articles of the treaty.</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> on this occasion
was seven officers and eighty men killed, and ten officers
and three hundred and twenty men wounded: total,
four hundred and seventeen; strength in the field, six
hundred and forty-two; remained, two hundred and
twenty-five.</p>

<p class="p1">The evening before this attack, there was an order
that the great coats and kits of the regiment should be
left in the house which the commanding officer had
occupied, under the charge of the Quartermaster; or,
in his absence, of a subaltern officer, with the sick or lame
men who could not march, as a guard for this baggage.
The Quartermaster was employed on the general staff
as an assistant engineer, and the tour of duty fell upon
Lieutenant Michael Barry, of the grenadier company;
but this high-spirited young man earnestly solicited, and
obtained permission, to accompany his regiment, and was
the first officer who fell the next day. No other subaltern
being found willing to remain behind, the charge was
entrusted to Quartermaster-Serjeant William Grady.
He was the first man who joined the corps on its formation,
and had been distinguished for his bravery, intelligence,
and trustworthiness; his guard, inefficient as it
must be, mustered somewhat more than twenty men.
In front of the house there was a thick orchard, with a
narrow path leading to it; upon this he placed double
sentries during the night, and a piquet of half his force
in the day-time. It appeared that at the further end of
this orchard a mounted body of the enemy was concealed;
these men had been posted in advance of the
town, but being unable to return, in consequence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
British troops having got between it and their position,
they determined to get into the country by this narrow
pass; but when they rushed out of the orchard, they
were fired upon by Serjeant Grady’s sentries, and, their
leader falling, they retreated into their cover, and after
several ineffectual attempts to escape in that direction,
the party, consisting of two officers and seventy men,
well mounted and armed, surrendered to the Quartermaster-Serjeant’s
small force. Having secured their
arms and ammunition, he marched the prisoners to head-quarters,
and delivered them up to Major-General
Gower. Two hours after he received written orders
from Lieut.-General Whitelocke to return the arms, &amp;c.
to the prisoners, who were released, and not to fire
upon or stop any party, whether armed or not, going
into or coming out of the town. At nine o’clock the
next night, upwards of five hundred mounted men came
out of the town and surrounded the house, the owner of
which was an officer of the party, who, in addition to
national hostility, was in a state of great irritation at
his house having been taken from him, and, as he
stated, plundered by the advanced guard of the British
army. They surrounded and made prisoners Serjeant
Grady and his party, who had orders not to fire upon
any armed body. They were marched into the town,
and thrust into loathsome dungeons. The Serjeant
was a peculiar object of revenge, because he refused to
accept a commission in their service, and to drill their
troops. This brave and excellent soldier was subsequently
rewarded for his exemplary conduct by being
appointed Quartermaster to the second battalion of the
regiment. After the capture of Serjeant Grady and his
party, the stores were plundered, and the baggage
carried off or destroyed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the intrepidity displayed by the
troops, the enterprise failed. On the morning of the
6th of July the Governor-General Liniers sent a letter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
to Lieut.-General Whitelocke, offering to restore the
prisoners taken in the action of the preceding day, and
also those made with Brigadier-General Beresford, on
condition that the whole of the British forces should be
withdrawn from South America, which proposals were
accepted. The Lieutenant-General’s conduct subsequently
became the subject of inquiry by a court-martial,
and he was cashiered.</p>

<p>During the attack upon Buenos Ayres, a number of
the Spanish and native soldiers were seen in the uniform
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment; this was accounted
for by a ship with the clothing for that regiment, which
had been sent out from England to Monte Video,
having been captured and carried into Buenos Ayres by
a Spanish privateer, and the clothing had thus been distributed
to the armed populace.</p>

<p>Subsequently to the assault on <i>Buenos Ayres</i>, the
Commander of the Forces issued the following general
order:—</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“<i>Buenos Ayres, 8th July 1807.</i></p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">General Order.</span></div>

<p>“Volunteer Peter Benson Husband, of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment, is appointed Ensign in that corps,
in consequence of his very gallant behaviour on the
morning of the 5th instant.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 4.5em;">(Signed)&nbsp; “<span class="smcap">T. Bradford</span>,</span><br>
“<i>Deputy-Adjutant-General</i>.”</p>
    </div>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> returned to Monte Video,
after the cessation of hostilities, and was completed by
volunteers from the different corps returning to Europe.
On the 2nd of August the regiment embarked for the
Cape of Good Hope; and on the 4th of September
following it landed at Simon’s Bay, and marched to
Cape Town, where it formed part of the garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1808.<br>1809.</div>

<p>During the years 1808 and 1809, the first battalion
continued to be stationed at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>

<p>On the 23rd of October 1810, the first battalion
embarked from the Cape, having been selected to form
part of an expedition designed to co-operate with troops
from India, under the command of Lieut.-General
John Abercromby, in the capture of the Mauritius. A
landing of the troops from India had taken place a few
days before the division from the Cape, under Major-General
William Cockell, had arrived. Its appearance
off the island was, however, particularly opportune, as
the French governor had previously resolved to defend
his lines before Port Louis; but when he saw the force
from the Cape approach the island, he relinquished the
hope of being able to make effectual resistance, and
surrendered this valuable colony to the British. The
battalion disembarked at Port Louis on the 1st of
December, where it remained on duty, after the other
regiments composing the expedition returned to their
respective quarters. Captain Henry C. Streatfeild with
two officers and one hundred men were embarked on
board a ship of war, in advance of the expedition, and
landed before the force from the Cape.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1811&#160;to<br>1814.</div>

<p>The first battalion continued to form part of the
garrison of the island during the four following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815.</div>

<p>In May 1815, the first battalion at the Mauritius
was directed to hold itself in readiness for active service
in India, and embarked on board of transports on the
16th of June, and landed at Fort William, in Bengal,
on the 3rd of August.</p>

<p>The light company embarked in an Arab ship, with
the flank companies of the Twelfth and Twenty-second
regiments, and were carried into the Gulf of Manaar;
the ship being there weather-bound, the troops were
landed, with the assistance of country-boats, at Calpenterre,
in Ceylon, and having remained fourteen days at
Point de Galle, embarked again in the Arab ship for
Calcutta, where they arrived, and rejoined the regiment
on the 25th of September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>On the 1st of October 1815, the first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment embarked in boats, and
sailed for Berhampore, where it arrived on the 14th,
and again embarked and sailed for Dinapore on the 13th
of November, at which place it disembarked on the
18th of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816.</div>

<p>The Rajah of Nepaul having broken the terms of
treaty made by him with the Honorable East India
Company, the battalion marched for his territories on
the 15th of January 1816, and arrived at Bullvee Camp
on the 24th, where it joined the army under the command
of Major-General Sir David Ochterlony, K.C.B.,
who commanded the forces assembled on the frontiers
of Nepaul; on the 3rd of February the brigades advanced
by their respective routes into Nepaul, Sir
David Ochterlony remaining in company with the third
and fourth brigades (to the former of which the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> belonged), and marched through the
forest at the foot of the Nepaul Hills on the 9th. The
light company of the battalion with those of the native
infantry of the brigade with two guns under the command
of Lieut. John Fenton, formed the advanced guard,
and had a very arduous duty to perform, in carrying the
guns through the forest, which was accomplished by the
personal exertions of each individual. On the 10th,
the third brigade arrived at Semul Cassa Pass, and at
nine o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the light company of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>,
commanded by Lieutenant Fenton, accompanied
by Sir David Ochterlony, was drawn up the pass,
a height of thirty feet, by the officers’ sashes, the brigade
then about five miles from the pass; on the 19th it
reached the village of Etoundah on the banks of the
Rapti. The advanced guard again exerted themselves
in opening a communication between the third and
fourth brigades through the Cheria Ghanty Pass.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February it arrived at Muckwanpore,
and on the 28th the brigade was ordered to take possession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
of the heights of <i>Sierapore</i>, and reconnoitre the
position of the enemy. Lieutenant Thomas Lee, with a
piquet of forty men of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, and strong
piquets of native infantry, under their own officers, was
directed to take possession of the deserted height of
Sierapore. Captain Pickersgill, acting Quartermaster-General,
conducted them to their ground, where having
planted them, Lieutenant Lee and twenty men of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> proceeded to reconnoitre the ground
in advance: the enemy advanced to recover his position;
the piquet retired, and the reconnoitering party, in
danger of being cut off; had to descend a hill covered
with jungle, pursued by a strong party (nearly four hundred)
of the enemy, and would not have escaped
but for the gallantry of two soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>,
Corporal James Orr of No. 5. company, and
Private Patrick Boyle of the Grenadier company, who
seeing the danger of the officers, placed themselves on
the pathway, and by their steadiness and fire, checked
the advance of the enemy. On the officers making
good their retreat, these gallant fellows retired uninjured:
the corporal was promoted to the rank of
serjeant at the particular desire of Major-General Sir
David Ochterlony; the unfortunate habit of drinking
alone prevented the promotion of the private. An
action afterwards took place, in which the light company,
under the command of Captain Fenton, suffered
considerably. The action commenced about noon, and
ceased at six o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, leaving the British in possession
of the heights for a considerable distance from
Sierapore, and of one field-piece.</p>

<p>In this affair Lieut.-Colonel Francis Miller commanding
the battalion, and Lieutenant Fenton<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in the command
of the light company (detached in the advance),
particularly distinguished themselves, and received the
public thanks of Major-General Sir David Ochterlony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and also of the Marquis of Hastings, the Commander-in-chief
and Governor-General of India. The regiment
had ten men killed, and above thirty wounded, many of
whom died; the loss of the enemy was very considerable.</p>

<p>The Rajah, perceiving that resistance was unavailing,
sued for peace, and a treaty was concluded on the 4th of
March; on the 9th of that month the battalion commenced
its return to Bengal, and arrived at Amowah on the
22nd of March, where it was cantoned until the 30th of
June, on which day it commenced its march to Govingunge
on the river Gonduck, and embarked in boats in
progress to Cawnpore; on the 17th of August, the
battalion arrived at Jangemowe, within a few miles of
Cawnpore, but did not disembark at the latter station,
until the 10th of September. About this period the battalion
became very sickly from being so long confined
in boats; the hospital list amounted to about four hundred
and eighty, exclusive of numbers who could not be
admitted for want of room. Not less than one hundred
and fifty men died in this and the following month, when
the cold weather coming on, in a great measure, renovated
the corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817.</div>

<p>On the 6th of February 1817, the regiment marched
from Cawnpore towards Hattrass, which fortress the
Commander-in-chief had given instructions to Major-General
Marshall to besiege: the division from Cawnpore
arrived before Hattrass, and joined the field army,
on the 20th of February.</p>

<p>The pettah of the fort of Hattrass having been
breached, it was resolved to storm on the evening of
the 25th of February, and accordingly his Majesty’s
Fourteenth regiment was appointed for that duty, and
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> to cover; however, the breach
being found impracticable, the troops returned to their
lines, but the pettah was evacuated during the night,
and taken possession of on the following morning by
the British troops; batteries were immediately erected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
against the fort, which was heavily bombarded with
shells and rockets: at length the principal magazine
blew up on the 2nd of March, the explosion of which
was said to be distinctly heard at Meerut, nearly two
hundred miles distant.</p>

<p>Dya Ram, Rajah of the fortress, having determined
on abandoning it, most gallantly cut his way through
some of the piquets of the besieging army, and effected
his escape. On the morning of the 3rd of March, the
right wing of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> marched into and
took possession of the fortress of Hattrass, which was
reduced to a mass of ruins. On the 8th of March the
regiment commenced its return to Cawnpore.</p>

<p>In July and August the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment,
in Bengal, was increased by a detachment of thirteen
serjeants, three drummers, and two hundred and sixty-nine
rank and file, men who had been transferred on
the second battalion being disbanded on the 1st of
February 1817.</p>

<p>The regiment remained at Cawnpore until the 15th
of October, when it received orders to march to Secundra,
where the grand army was formed under the command
of the Marquis of Hastings, against the Pindaree
hordes, and having remained there until a bridge of
boats was completed over the Jumna, it crossed that
river on the 27th, and marched to the banks of the
Sind, opposite Gualior; but the grand army being,
about this time, attacked by that fatal disease, the cholera
morbus, compelled the Marquis, with his troops, to retire
to Erich on the Bettwah: the mortality for four or
five days was very great, particularly among the natives,
who died in vast numbers on the road and in the villages
through which the army passed. The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
lost one subaltern (Lieutenant John Coghlan),
three serjeants, and forty rank and file; total, forty-four,
in three days. The army having in some measure recovered,
his Lordship returned to the banks of the Sind,
and took up a position at Lonaree, within twenty-one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
miles of Gualior, where Scindiah, with a powerful
force, was ready to take the field, to support the Mahratta
States, which had revolted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818.</div>

<p>On the 14th of February 1818, the different divisions of
the army were broken up, in consequence of peace being
concluded, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> returned to Cawnpore,
at which station it arrived on the 26th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820.</div>

<p>On the 21st of October 1820, the regiment marched
from Cawnpore for Fort William, by the new road, and
arrived in that garrison on the 21st of December, a distance
of six hundred and sixty miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821.</div>

<p>On the night of the 6th of September 1821, a very
alarming fire broke out in the Honorable Company’s
Dispensary, situated in Calcutta, and surrounded by
many valuable houses. As soon as intelligence reached
the fort, two captains and ten subalterns, with about
three hundred men, immediately marched to the spot,
and, by the greatest exertions, prevented the fire from
spreading to the neighbouring houses. The strictness
with which the armed party protected the property of
the inhabitants, called forth their admiration, which was
followed by the annexed letter from the Governor-General,
the Marquis of Hastings.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">

of the men have suffered in articles of dress, to repair
that damage, as well as to reward the activity of the

<p class="p1">A very handsome piece of plate, which is now in

by Doctor M<sup>c</sup>Whirter, whose house adjoined the Dispensary,
and which was saved by great exertion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822.</div>

<p>In April 1822, another alarming fire occurred in
Calcutta, at the cotton stores of Mr. Laprimaudage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
in which a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> exerted
itself in a very laudable manner, and a letter of
thanks was received by Lieut.-Colonel Miller, from
that gentleman, for the service rendered by the officers
and men on this occasion.</p>

<p>In 1822 the arrival of regiments from Europe, caused
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> to embark (by wings) in boats
for the Upper Provinces, and on the 11th of July the
right wing sailed for Dinapore, the left following on
the 22nd of that month.</p>

<p>The right wing experienced bad weather and lost
a number of boats, by which one serjeant, two drummers,
five women, and four children were drowned.
On the 19th of August the right wing landed at
Dinapore, and the left on the 25th, having made a very
prosperous voyage, not meeting with a single accident
in the passage: on the 1st of November, the regiment
marched to Ghazeepore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823.</div>

<p>On the 17th of May 1823, Lieut.-Colonel Francis M.
Miller, C.B., died, after having served his Majesty upwards
of thirty-four years, during which he had commanded
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment at different
periods for sixteen years. He was deeply and most deservedly
regretted by every officer and soldier who had
served with him, and had invariably received the marked
approbation of every general officer under whom he had
been placed. The command of the regiment subsequently
devolved on Lieut.-Colonel Matthew Shawe, C.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824.</div>

<p>Serjeant Stephen Carr was appointed quartermaster on
the 24th of June 1824, as a reward for his distinguished
gallantry and honorable trustworthy conduct: he was
present in every action in which the second battalion
was employed during the Peninsular war.</p>

<p>In consequence of the Forty-seventh regiment having
embarked at Calcutta for Ava, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
left Ghazeepore in boats oh the 9th of June 1824, and
reached Berhampore on the 29th of the same month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1825.</div>

<p>On the 14th of January 1825, the regiment proceeded
towards Calcutta to replace the second battalion
of the Royals on its departure for Ava; the left wing
moved by land, the right by water, and were reunited
on the 29th in Fort William, of which garrison Lieut.-Colonel
Shawe became commandant.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June, the regiment performed the
melancholy duty of attending to the grave the remains
of its beloved and lamented commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel
Henry Browne. He had entered the regiment
in 1800 as an ensign, when sixteen years of age, and had
never belonged to any other: his qualities as a man and a
soldier endeared him to all. In the meantime hostilities
had commenced between the British and the Burmese,
and on the 5th of October the regiment embarked for
Ava, to reinforce the army in that country, in four
divisions, which landed at Rangoon between the 3rd
and 10th of November, and immediately proceeded in
boats towards Prome, the head-quarters of the army.
During the passage, Major William Slade Gully’s division
was attacked from the bank of the river, on the
25th of November, by a strong party of Burmese, which
was immediately repulsed on the troops being landed.
Lieutenant and Adjutant James Bowes, in command of
the advanced guard, was wounded, and two privates
killed.</p>

<p>Six companies of the regiment, with Major Gully,
Captains Charles Lucas and George Rodney Bell, and
John Day; Lieutenants John Baylee, William Bateman,
Robert Joseph Kerr, William Lenox Stafford,
with Assistant Surgeons William Brown, M.D., and
William Peter Birmingham, reached Prome in time
to share in the operations of the 1st and 2nd of December,
which terminated in the entire discomfiture of
the enemy. On this occasion the regiment maintained
its unvarying reputation for cool and distinguished
gallantry: Lieutenant Baylee and two men were killed;
Major Gully and twenty-one men were wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1826.</div>

<p>On the 8th of January 1826, Lieut.-Colonel Hunter
Blair joined the regiment, and was appointed a Brigadier,
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> being in his brigade.</p>

<p>On the 19th of January Brigadier Thomas Hunter
Blair, Lieut.-Colonel of the regiment, commanded the
right column of attack at the capture of <i>Melloone</i>, consisting
of the Eighty-ninth regiment and the flank companies
of the Forty-seventh and <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
with Captain James Moore (major of brigade), Brevet
Captain James Kennelly, Lieutenants Henry Gough
Baylee, Edmund Cox, George Mainwaring, William
Lenox Stafford, and Joseph Thomas, and Assistant
Surgeon Birmingham. No loss was sustained.</p>

<p>The day after the fall of <i>Melloone</i>, the Bengal division,
under Brigadier Shawe, made a flank movement from
the river Irrawaddy, and entered a well-cultivated
country abounding in cattle, eight hundred head of
which were secured, and they proved a most seasonable
supply to the army.</p>

<p>On the 28th of January the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, with
the flank companies of the Twenty-eighth native infantry,
and detachments of the Governor-General’s body-guard
and artillery, under Brigadier Hunter Blair,
were sent from Tongwyn, to attack the position of
<i>Moulmein</i>, eleven miles distant. The flank companies of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> had one man killed and five
wounded in forcing a piquet half way to Moulmein,
which had been in part evacuated the preceding day.
The position, being a great annoyance to the surrounding
country, was destroyed, and the troops returned to
camp the same evening.</p>

<p>On the 21st of February, the Bengal division rejoined
head-quarters at Yandaboo; and on the 24th of
February a royal salute announced the termination of
the Burmese war.</p>

<p>The constancy and valour of the British troops had
thus forced the monarch of an Eastern empire, with its
myriads of inhabitants, to sue for peace; and their conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
is thus alluded to in the order issued by the
Governor-General of India.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p>“While the Governor-General in Council enumerates,
with sentiments of unfeigned admiration, the achievements
of the First or Royals, the Thirteenth,
Thirty-eighth, Forty-first, Forty-fifth, Forty-seventh,
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, and Eighty-ninth regiments, the
Honorable Company’s Madras European regiment,
and the Bengal and Madras European artillery, as
the European troops which have had the honor of
establishing the renown of the British arms in a
new and distant region, his Lordship in Council feels
that higher and more justly-merited praise cannot be
bestowed on those brave troops than that, amidst the
barbarous hosts which they have fought and conquered,
they have eminently displayed the virtues
and sustained the character of the British soldier.”</p>
    </div>

<p>In commemoration of the meritorious conduct of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> and other corps, the royal authority
was subsequently granted for the word “<span class="smcap">Ava</span>” to be
borne on the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>Brigadier Shawe, on the 1st of March, was compelled
to proceed to Rangoon, in consequence of ill health.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March, the portion of the army that
was ordered to return by land, marched from Yandaboo,
under the command of Brigadier Hunter Blair. It consisted
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, the Governor-General’s
body-guard, the Horse artillery, the Twenty-eighth,
Thirty-eighth, and Forty-third Madras native infantry,
and a battalion of the Madras pioneers. The column
reached Prome, a distance of two hundred and ninety
miles, on the 3rd of April, having had only one
halting day, which was St. Patrick’s.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> remained at Prome, as the
rear-guard of the army, until the arrangements for the
final evacuation of the province was completed; on the
15th of April it embarked in the flotilla, and reached
Rangoon on the 21st of that month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>On the 27th of April was received the melancholy intelligence
of the death of Lieut.-Colonel Matthew Shawe,
C.B., which lamented event took place on board His Majesty’s
sloop, “Slany,” Captain Thornton, on the 10th of
that month, within one day’s sail of Penang, where he
was buried with all military honors. He was much
regretted as an excellent man, and an officer of conspicuous
gallantry. His life was sacrificed to his zeal for
active service, for such was the state of his health, on
leaving Calcutta, that his medical advisers used every
endeavour to dissuade him from proceeding to Ava.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Hunter Blair, became senior Lieut.-Colonel
of the regiment, of which he assumed the command
on the 1st of June, on the reduction of the staff
in Ava.</p>

<p>On the 1st of September, Lieutenant Edmund Cox,
with twenty-eight flankers, proceeded to Ava, as escort
to the envoy, they being the first British soldiers who
had visited that capital.</p>

<p>An order was received at Rangoon, on the 16th of
October, directing that in consequence of the intended
return of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> to England, the men
should be permitted to volunteer for the Forty-fifth
regiment, also in garrison: one hundred and twenty-three
men availed themselves of this offer.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October, the head-quarters embarked
for Calcutta, which they reached on the 16th
of November, and were joined by the rest of the regiment
on the 24th of that month.</p>

<p>Besides those already named, the regiment had to
regret the death (in Ava) of two old and much valued
officers, Captain Peter Benson Husband and Surgeon
Alexander Leslie; and of Lieutenant Nicholas Milley
Doyle, and Ensign Richard Loveday, two most promising
young men, who were drowned in the Irrawaddy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
and of above one hundred and eighty non-commissioned
officers and soldiers, chiefly from dysentery.</p>

<p>After the return of the regiment from Ava, it had
the honor of being reviewed at Calcutta by General
Lord Combermere, G.C.B., Commander-in-chief in
India, and inspected by Major-General Robert Alexander
Dalzell, afterwards the Earl of Carnwath.</p>

<p>On the 13th of November, the volunteering re-commenced,
and continued, with intervals, to the 27th of
December, during which two hundred and fifty-nine
men turned out, for the Sixteenth lancers, Thirteenth,
Thirty-first, Thirty-eighth, and Forty-fourth regiments
and East India Company’s service, reducing the regiment
in India to two hundred and eighty men.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1827.</div>

<p>On the 1st of February the head-quarters, with nine
companies, sailed from Calcutta in the free trader
“Lord Lynedoch,” leaving the remainder of the regiment
to follow in the “Cornwall.”</p>

<p>It may be remarked, as a singular circumstance, that
the regiment should return to England in a ship bearing
the name of the hero under whom it gained the decoration
of the eagle at Barrosa, and still more remarkable,
that its actual commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel
Hunter Blair, had proceeded to India in the “Barrosa.”</p>

<p>The following general order, dated the 29th of
January, was published by his Excellency General
Lord Combermere, on the embarkation of the regiment.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Commander-in-Chief having directed the embarkation
of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment, on its
return home, his Lordship cannot allow the corps to
leave India, without expressing his high approbation
of its services. Of the conduct of this corps, during
its services in Ava, his Lordship has had the most
favourable reports; and he has every confidence that,
wherever its future destinies may lead it, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment will always add to its spirited
and distinguished military reputation.”</p>
    </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>On the 27th of April the head-quarters reached St.
Helena, and remained there four days.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of June 1827 the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
landed in England, and was placed on the British
establishment from that day inclusive, and marched
into Chatham Barracks; from thence, after being inspected,
and the invalids discharged, the regiment was
moved by water on the 7th of July to Albany Barracks,
Isle of Wight, the effective strength at head-quarters
being two hundred and eighty rank and file.</p>

<p>In consequence of the continued career of brilliant
services which has distinguished the regiment from its
first taking the field, to its return to England, a period
of thirty-three years, General Sir John Doyle felt it
an imperative duty, as its Colonel, to bring those services
under the notice of its revered and beloved
Sovereign, and humbly to solicit for the corps some
mark of His Majesty’s royal favour.</p>

<p>The gracious manner in which the King had condescended
to view the conduct of his <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment, and the encouraging expressions with which
His Majesty has been pleased to convey his approbation
of its services, must be so cheering to the hearts of every
member of the corps, that the circumstance naturally
claims a place in the records of the regiment.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June 1827, the Colonel addressed the
following letter to the Adjutant-General of the Forces,
Major-General Sir Henry Torrens, K.C.B.:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“<i>4. Somerset Street, Portman Square,</i><br>

<div>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</div>

<p>“I have the honor to represent to you that
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment, under my command,
has arrived in England, after a service of twenty-one
years in tropical climates.</p>

<p>“It has just returned from the Burmese campaign,
where it has obtained additional honors to those it
had formerly won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>“To you, Sir, who so well know the character of
every corps in the army, it is unnecessary to detail
the services of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>. It is now
thirty-three years since I had the honor to raise it,
thirty-one years of which period it has been upon
foreign service; on the continent of Europe, the Peninsula,
South America, and the East and West
Indies. In all the well-fought actions where it bore
a part in both hemispheres, it has been distinguished
in general orders. My authority is the Government
Gazette.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, may I be permitted to
hope that you will do me the favour to lay at His
Majesty’s feet my humble petition that the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment may be appointed a light infantry
corps, which, as being a mark of His Majesty’s approbation,
would be most gratifying to those brave
men, who have so freely bled, and would lay down
their lives, to manifest their devoted attachment to
their gracious and beloved Sovereign. Perhaps, Sir,
you will have the less difficulty in complying with
my request, when I mention that, immediately after
the action of Barrosa, I received the following note
from Lord Lynedoch, written from the field of battle:</p>
    </div>

        <div class="blockquot pad3">

<div>“<span class="smcap">My dear Doyle</span>,</div>

it and its commander to the notice of its illustrious
patron, the Prince Regent. Too much cannot be done for
the corps.”</p>
        </div>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p>“I presented it to his Royal Highness, who graciously
said, ‘It is very true, and I will do any thing you
wish for the regiment; will you have it made <i>Royal</i>?’
I respectfully declined the honor, for reasons his Royal
Highness did not disapprove.</p>

<p>“For the correctness of this statement I humbly appeal
to His Majesty, who never forgets any circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>

more than one trophy captured from the enemy, and
by the interest His Majesty must always take in a
regiment which possesses, from its title, an early and
peculiar claim to his protection.</p>

<p>“But with every disposition to accede to your wishes,
the King laments that it is out of his power to grant

<p>In his reply to the above communication, in a letter
dated the 11th of July 1827, General Sir John Doyle
preferred a request, that the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> might be
styled the “<i>Prince of Wales’s Own Irish Regiment of

<div class="blockquot">

the endearing title we so highly prize</i>; <i>retain the national
colours under which we have so long fought</i>; and
avoid collision with any regiment that might have
been honored with the name of Royal.”</p>
</div>

<p>This request was complied with, and the result was

<p>The regiment was inspected on the 2nd of November
by Major-General Sir James Lyon, K.C.B. and G.C.H.,
who was pleased to express his unqualified approbation
of the progress made during four months in the formation
of a corps nearly composed of recruits, and which
he declared to have surpassed his most sanguine expectation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828.</div>

<p>On the 19th of May 1828 the regiment was reviewed
by General Lord Hill, commanding in chief, who expressed
himself highly pleased with its evolutions and
general appearance; and his Lordship also alluded to
the favorable opinion entertained of the corps by the
inhabitants of the Isle of Wight, in consequence of its
quiet and orderly conduct in quarters.</p>

<p>The regiment was inspected on the 5th of June by
Major-General Sir Colin Campbell, K.C.B., and had
the gratification of obtaining his approbation.</p>

<p>The regiment, which, upon its arrival at Albany Barracks
eleven months previously, had only two hundred
and eighty rank and file present, was now within thirty-four
of its establishment (seven hundred and forty),
the recruits having been chiefly enlisted in Dublin, Cork,
Limerick, Carrick-on-Shannon, and Galway.</p>

<p>The regiment quitted Albany Barracks on the 7th of
July, where it had been stationed one year, and marched
by Portsmouth and Maidstone to Chatham, which it
reached on the 15th of that month.</p>

<p>On the 24th July, a route was received directing the
regiment to march immediately for London, thence to
proceed by the Paddington Canal to such destination as
might be ordered. It was mustered, and marched in
three hours after the receipt of the route, and arrived
in Lambeth on the third day.</p>

<p>The regiment was reviewed on the 28th of July by
General Sir John Doyle, Bart., attended by Major-General
Sir Henry Torrens, K.C.B., Adjutant-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
of the forces, and numerous other officers, when its appearance
elicited <ins class="corr" id="tn-35" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'unqualified appprobation'">
unqualified approbation</ins>.</p>

<p>On the 29th of July the regiment embarked in seventeen
boats on the Paddington Canal, landed at Northwich
and Middlewich on the 2nd, and marched into
Chester Castle on the 4th of August.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September two alarming fires
broke out in the city of Chester: the very serious consequences
that threatened were chiefly counteracted by
the bold and active intrepidity displayed by the soldiers
of the regiment in extinguishing the conflagration, and
by the exertions of the officers to secure the property
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>These services were acknowledged in a vote of thanks
from the Commissioners of Police to Lieut.-Colonel
Blair, the officers, and soldiers of the regiment.</p>

<p>Various letters of thanks to the regiment also appeared
in the Chester newspapers, from those inhabitants
whose property was chiefly endangered.</p>

<p>On the 11th of October the regiment was inspected
by Major-General Sir Henry Bouverie, K.C.B., who
was pleased to express himself much pleased with its
appearance, movements, and interior economy.</p>

<p>A circular from the Horse Guards, dated the 5th of
December, was received, which directed regiments not
to recruit beyond six hundred and ninety rank and file,
being fifty short of the nominal establishment of seven
hundred and forty rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829.</div>

<p>On the 19th of April 1829, under instruction from
the Secretary of State, three companies, commanded by
Major Gully, marched towards Abergelly, in Denbighshire,
forty miles distant, in order to prevent a riot,
expected on the ejection by the high sheriff, at the
suit of the Bishop of St. Asaph, of a body of miners,
from an extensive lime quarry, of which they refused
to give up possession, in consequence of having enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the privilege of working it for many years. The
miners having submitted, the detachment rejoined head-quarters
in four days, and fortunately without its
interference being required.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May the regiment was again inspected
by Major-General Sir Henry Bouverie, and received
his entire approbation.</p>

<p>The regiment moved from Chester on the 19th of
May, where it had been quartered between nine and ten
months. Previously to its departure, the following letter
was received from the mayor of Chester.</p>

<p>On the 7th of July, the regiment left Salford Barracks,
Manchester, and occupied the following stations.
Head-quarters and four companies at Bolton in Lancashire;
four companies at Blackburn, and two companies
at Oldham. Prior to quitting Manchester a
letter was received from Robert Sharpe, Esq., constable
of Manchester, expressive of the regret of his
colleagues, the inhabitants of the place, and himself, at
the sudden departure of the regiment, and in which a
marked tribute was paid by the authorities to its “<i>exemplary
conduct</i>” while stationed in that town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830.</div>

<p>On the 25th of December 1830, the regiment commenced
wearing the royal uniform and appointments, in
compliance with the Adjutant-General’s letter of the 15th
of October 1827: also Oxford-mixture pantaloons, which
were introduced into the army by circular, dated 10th
of February 1829.</p>

<p>By circular letter from the Adjutant-General, dated
the 18th of March, a red fatigue jacket was substituted
for the infantry of the army, in lieu of the white jacket
formerly in wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>By a circular letter from the Adjutant-General,
dated the 22nd of April, regiments were directed not to
recruit beyond six hundred and sixty rank and file, being
eighty under the nominal establishment of seven hundred
and forty.</p>

<p>The regiment was twice inspected at Manchester by
Major-General Sir Henry Bouverie, on the 21st of
November 1829, and the 28th of May 1830, on which
last occasion the Major-General declared that it had
gained, in all respects, his most unqualified approbation.</p>

<p>The regiment remained at Manchester until July
1830, when it was removed to Bolton-le-Moors: it embarked
for Ireland in September following, and was
stationed at Newry until November, when it returned
to England, and was quartered at Plymouth.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1831.</div>

<p>On the 1st of January 1831, an orderly-room clerk
was authorised to be borne on the establishment.</p>

<p>In the early part of the year 1831, directions were
given for the formation of the regiment into six service
and four depôt companies, and on the 23rd of February
the service companies embarked for the Mauritius, where
they arrived in June following: the depôt companies
were left at Devonport.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1833.<br>1834.</div>

<p>The depôt companies remained at Devonport until
October 1833, when they proceeded to Fort Cumberland;
from thence to Gosport in December following,
and to Portsmouth in February 1834.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August 1834, Major-General Sir

September 1839.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August 1839, the establishment of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> Royal Irish Fusiliers was increased

<p>The depôt companies of the regiment returned to
England in June 1840, and were stationed at Carlisle:
they were removed to Tynemouth in May, and to Hull
in June 1841: they remained at the latter station until
August 1842, when they proceeded to Airdrie, and in
the following month they marched to Paisley.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March 1841, Major-General Sir Hugh

Brigadier-General William Carr Beresford, afterwards General Viscount
Beresford; the place was, however, recovered by the Spaniards in August
following, and the troops became prisoners.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1806, an armament, consisting of the Ninth and
Seventeenth light dragoons, detachment of the Twenty-first light dragoons,
Royal artillery and engineers, Fortieth, first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>,
and Ninety-fifth (rifle corps) regiments, proceeded to share in
the contest in South America. In October the Thirty-eighth regiment
commanded by Colonel Vassal, and the Forty-seventh, under Colonel
Backhouse, proceeded from the Cape of Good Hope to the Rio de la
Plata, and on finding that Buenos Ayres had been recaptured by the
Spaniards, the troops under the command of Colonel Backhouse, in conjunction
with the naval squadron under Commodore Sir Home
Popham, took possession of the town of Maldonado, and the island of
Gorreti, on the left bank of the river Plate. In the summer of 1807 an
expedition for a second attempt on Buenos Ayres proceeded to that part
of the world, under the command of Lieut.-General Whitelocke, who assumed
the command of the troops in South America. Other corps had
also proceeded to South America, of which a list is inserted in the

<div class="sidenote">1804.</div>

<p class="p1 noindent">The British Government continued to adopt the most
vigorous measures for the defence of the kingdom, and
for the prosecution of the war. In addition to the acts of
Parliament passed in July 1803 for raising “<i>The Army
of Reserve</i>,” further Acts were passed in June and July
1804 for levying a larger number of men in the several
counties of Great Britain and Ireland, which were
termed the “<i>Additional Force Acts</i>.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment was augmented by
a second battalion, which, with seven other regiments,
was appointed to receive men raised in <i>Ireland</i> under
the act of the 14th of July 1804; the men raised in
the counties of <i>Tipperary</i>, <i>Galway</i>, and <i>Clare</i>, were
allotted to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment; the assembling
quarter of the second battalion was appointed
at Frome in Somersetshire, and the battalion was placed
on the establishment of the army, from the 25th of
December 1804, at six hundred rank and file, which
was augmented in the following year to eight hundred,
and in the year 1807 to one thousand rank and
file, and continued at that number to December 1814,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
when it was reduced to eight hundred, and from December
1815 to six hundred rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1805.</div>

<p>The second battalion marched from Frome to Bristol
in March 1805, and embarked for Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1806.</div>

<p>On the 27th of October 1806 the battalion, consisting
of twenty-nine serjeants, nine drummers, and five hundred
and sixty-eight rank and file, embarked from Ireland
for England.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1807.</div>

<p>On the 27th of April 1807 the battalion embarked
at Plymouth, and proceeded to Guernsey.</p>

<p>The following report was made to Lieut.-General
Sir John Doyle, Bart., commanding the troops at
Guernsey, by Brigadier-General John Fraser, after his
inspection of the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“<i>Guernsey, 30th June 1807.</i></p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</div>

<p>“I have the honor to report, that when I minutely
inspected the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment two months after their arrival in this island,
I found every thing in a state of perfection that would
have done credit to an old established regiment, and
which could not have been expected in a battalion so
lately formed. The flank companies are uncommonly
fine. The battalion men are in general of good size,
young and stout, and the whole appear healthy and well
fed: they march well, are steady under arms, and
perfect in their discipline. The interior regulations
are excellent, barracks and hospital clean, books regular,
women and children decent in their appearance,
<i>and every thing to be commended</i>. The appointments
are in good order, the clothing is very good and well
fitted, gaiters, shoes, &amp;c. good without exception.
There have been very few courts martial, very few
non-commissioned officers reduced, and <i>not one punished
man in the battalion</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“The officers are well dressed and very attentive to
their duty. Since their arrival here, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
have occupied the town district, where I
have had daily opportunities of seeing them, and I
have always found them attentive on duty, well
dressed in the streets, quiet and regular, no complaints,
no drunkenness, even at the monthly settlements.</p>

<p>“I am of opinion that the second battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> is fit for any service, and very
likely to be distinguished, especially while commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Doyle, who appears one
of the best and most attentive officers I have ever
seen, and who is to be particularly commended for
keeping up very strict discipline without the least
appearance of severity.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 8.5em;">“I have, &amp;c.,</span><br>

<div class="negin1">
“<i>To Lieut.-General Sir John Doyle, Bart., commanding<br>
His Majesty’s Forces in Guernsey and Alderney.</i>”</div>
    </div>


<p>The above report of Brigadier-General Fraser was
highly gratifying to His Royal Highness the Duke of
York, Commander-in-Chief, whose approbation thereof
was signified to Lieut.-Colonel Doyle, and to the
second battalion, through Lieut.-General Sir John
Doyle, by the Adjutant-General on the 10th of July
1807.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>

<p>Important events had in the meantime occurred on
the continent of Europe. Napoleon having reduced
Germany to submission to his will, and forced Russia to
accede to his decrees, next attempted the subjugation of
Spain and Portugal. The Spaniards and Portuguese
rose in arms to assert their national rights, the French
emperor having conferred the crown of Spain on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
brother Joseph, who relinquished the throne of Naples
in favour of Marshal Murat. In the summer of 1808
Portugal was delivered by a British army under Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley, and in the autumn
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore received orders to advance
with a body of British troops from Portugal into
the heart of Spain; several regiments were embarked
from the United Kingdom to co-operate in the enterprise.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June 1808, the battalion embarked
from Guernsey, proceeded to Harwich, and from thence
to Ramsgate, having previously occupied Weely Barracks
and Danbury Camp.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Charles W. Doyle<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> having been appointed
a brigadier-general and employed on a special
mission in Spain, the command of the second battalion
devolved upon Major Hugh Gough, and on the 28th of
December following, it embarked at Ramsgate to join
the army under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, with
numerous supplies of men and stores; but being dispersed
by a storm, it rendezvoused at Cork, from whence
it was ordered to proceed to Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>

<p>The battalion arrived at Lisbon on the 12th of March
1809, and joined the army under the command of Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley. It was employed in the
operations against the French at Oporto, and advanced
in April following in pursuit of the French army, which
had retreated from Portugal towards Madrid.</p>

<p>After suffering many privations in common with the
rest of the troops, a junction was effected at Oropesa on
the 20th of July with the Spanish army under General
Cuesta. On the 27th of July, when General Cuesta
had retreated from Alcabon under cover of Lieut.-General
Sherbrooke’s divisions, Lieut.-General Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Arthur Wellesley, K.B., withdrew to the position
of <i>Talavera</i>, leaving Major-General John Randoll
McKenzie on the Alberche to protect the movement.
When the French on the 27th of July crossed this
river, Major-General McKenzie’s division was posted
near the Casa des Salinas, his infantry in the forest,
and cavalry on the plain. The attack was somewhat
sudden, and the second battalions of the Thirty-first
and <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiments, which were in the
wood on the right of the Alberche, sustained some loss.
As the enemy increased his numbers on the British side
of the river, Major-General McKenzie fell back gradually,
and entering the position by the left of the combined
army, took up his ground in a second line in rear
of the foot guards. In the dusk of the evening the
enemy commenced his attack on the British left, but
failed. In the night the attack was repeated, and on
the morning of the 28th of July the French renewed
the attack on the height on the British left, and were
again repulsed with considerable loss.</p>

<p>After a pause of some hours the attacks were renewed
upon the whole British front, and the action became
general. Brigadier-General Alexander Campbell’s
division, on the British right, sustained the assault of
the enemy’s fourth corps, assisted by Major-General
McKenzie’s brigade. “The English regiments, putting
the French skirmishers aside, met the advancing
columns with loud shouts, and breaking in on their
front, and lapping their flanks with fire, and giving
no respite, pushed them back with a terrible carnage.
Ten guns were taken; but as General Campbell
prudently forbore pursuit, the French rallied on their
supports, and made a show of attacking again. Vain
attempt! The British artillery and musketry played
too vehemently upon their masses, and a Spanish
regiment of cavalry charging on their flank at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
same time, the whole retired in disorder, and the
victory was secured in that quarter.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In the action on the 28th of July, Major-General
McKenzie, who commanded the division of which the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> formed part, was killed.</p>

<p>The news of the victory of <i>Talavera</i> gained over the
French army, commanded by Joseph Bonaparte in
person, excited great joy in England, and Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley was raised to the peerage
by the title of Viscount Wellington.</p>

<p>The loss of the British amounted to six thousand in
killed, wounded, and missing; that of the French was
much more considerable. The loss sustained by <i>the
second battalion of the</i> <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> <i>regiment</i> consisted
of one officer and one hundred and ten men killed,
and thirteen officers and two hundred and thirty men
wounded: total three hundred and fifty-four; strength
in the field, eight hundred and twenty-six, leaving a
remainder of four hundred and seventy-two.</p>

<p>Acting Serjeant-Major Paterson was promoted to
an ensigncy for good conduct in this action, and Quartermaster-Serjeant
Cowell was shortly afterwards promoted
also to an ensigncy for length of service and
gallant conduct.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> subsequently received the
royal authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Talavera</span>,” on the
regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of the conduct of the second battalion on that occasion.</p>

<p>The junction of the divisions of Marshals Soult,
Ney, and Mortier, in the rear of the British, compelled
them to fall back on Badajoz. On the 10th
of September, the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment received orders to repair to Lisbon,
where it arrived on the 24th; and two strong
detachments having arrived from England, and a number
of wounded men joining from the hospitals, the
battalion was again reported fit for service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810.</div>

<p>On the 5th of February 1810, the battalion embarked
at Lisbon for <i>Cadiz</i>, and disembarked there on
the 12th, which city was at that time besieged by a
powerful French army, under Marshal Soult. The
whole of this year the battalion was employed in erecting
batteries, and strengthening the defence of the
place, during which the battalion lost several men.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Thomas Graham (afterwards Lord
Lynedoch) commanded the British forces in Cadiz, and
an expedition was resolved upon for the purpose of
making a combined attack on the rear of the blockading
army under Marshal Victor, who now commanded at
the siege of Cadiz, in consequence of Marshal Soult
having proceeded with a body of troops into Estremadura.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1811.</div>

<p>On the 18th of February 1811, the battalion embarked
at Cadiz, and sailed for Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The army under the command of Lieut.-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Graham consisted of about three thousand men<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, and a
body of seven thousand troops commanded by General
La Pena. The force of which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
formed part, disembarked at Algesiras on the 23rd of
February, and the troops being united at Tarifa, marched
from thence on the 28th of February.</p>

<p>General Zayas pushed a strong body of Spanish
troops across the river Santi Petri near the coast on
the 1st of March, threw a bridge over, and formed a
<i>tête-de-pont</i>. This post was attacked by the enemy on
the nights of the 3rd and 4th of March, who was repulsed,
though the Spaniards sustained considerable
loss.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March 1811, Lieut.-General Graham,
and the army under his command, arrived on the low
ridge of <i>Barrosa</i>, and gained a decisive victory over the
French army under Marshal Victor, composed of the
two divisions of Generals Rufin and Laval.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which Lieut.-General Graham
found himself placed were such as compelled him
to attack the very superior force, in point of numbers,
of his opponents. The allied army, after a night-march
of sixteen hours from the camp near Veger, arrived on
the morning of the 5th at the low ridge of <i>Barrosa</i>, about
four miles to the southward of the mouth of the Santi
Petri river. This height extends inland about a mile and
a half, continuing on the north the extensive heathy plain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
of Chiclana. A great pine forest skirts the plain, and
circles round the height at some distance, terminating
down to Santi Petri, the intermediate space between the
north side of the height and the forest being uneven and
broken. A well-conducted and successful attack on the
rear of the enemy’s lines near Santi Petri by the vanguard
of the Spaniards under Brigadier-General Ladrizabel,
opened the communication with the Isla de Leon,
and Lieut.-General Graham received General La Pena’s
directions to move down from the position of Barrosa
to that of the Torre de Bermeja, about half way to the
Santi Petri river, in order to secure the communication
across the river, over which a bridge had been recently
constructed. This latter position occupied a narrow
woody ridge, the right on the sea cliff, the left falling
down to the Almanza creek on the edge of the marsh.
An easy communication between the western points of
these two positions was kept up by a hard sandy beach.
Lieut.-General Graham, while on the march through
the wood towards the Bermeja, received intelligence that
the enemy had appeared in force on the plain of Chiclana,
about fifty miles from Tarifa, and was advancing
towards the heights of <i>Barrosa</i>.</p>

<p>The British general, considering that position as the
key to that of Santi Petri, immediately countermarched
in order to support the troops left for its defence, and
the alacrity with which this manœuvre was executed
served as a favourable omen. It was, however, impossible
in such intricate and difficult ground to preserve
order in the columns, and time was never afforded to
restore it entirely.</p>

<p>Before the British could get quite disentangled from
the wood, the troops on the <i>Barrosa</i> hill were seen returning
from it, while the enemy’s left wing was rapidly
ascending. His right wing at the same time stood on
the plain, on the edge of the wood, within cannon-shot.
A retreat in the face of such an enemy, already within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
reach of the easy communication by the sea-beach, must
have involved the whole allied army in all the danger of
being attacked during the unavoidable confusion of the
different corps arriving nearly at the same time on the
narrow ridge of the Bermeja.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Graham relying on the heroism of
British troops, and regardless of the number and position
of the enemy, determined on an immediate attack.
Major Duncan soon opened a powerful battery of ten
guns in the centre. The right wing proceeded to the
attack of General Rufin’s division on the hill, while
that under General Laval, notwithstanding the havoc
made by Major Duncan’s battery, continued to advance
in very imposing masses, opening his fire of musketry,
and was only checked by that of the left wing.</p>

<p>The left wing now advanced firing; and a most determined
charge by the three companies of Guards and the
second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment, supported
by the remainder of the wing, soon decided the
defeat of General Laval’s division. In this charge the
Eagle of the eighth French regiment of light infantry
(which suffered immensely) and a howitzer were captured,
and remained in possession of Major Gough, now
Lieut.-General Viscount Gough, G.C.B., and colonel of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> These attacks were
zealously supported by Colonel Belson with the Twenty-eighth,
and Lieut.-Colonel Prevost with a portion of
the Sixty-seventh regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>A reserve formed beyond the narrow valley, across
which the enemy was closely pursued, next shared the
same fate, and was routed by the same means.</p>

<p>The right wing meanwhile was not less successful,
and, after a sanguinary contest, General Rufin’s division
was driven from the heights in confusion, leaving two
pieces of cannon. In less than an hour and a half from
the commencement of the action, the French were in
full retreat. The retiring division met, halted, and
seemed inclined to form; but a new and more advanced
position of the British artillery quickly dispersed the
enemy. The exhausted state of the troops rendered
pursuit impossible, and a position was occupied on the
eastern side of the hill. When the conflict had ceased,
Lieut.-General Graham remained on the field of battle;
but the Spanish general, La Pena, who had looked on
while this terrible battle was fought, did not seize the
favourable opportunity which the valour of the British
troops had put into his hands, of striking a severe blow
at the remains of the French army retreating in disorder.
The inactivity of the Spaniards continuing, the
British proceeded to Cadiz on the following day.</p>

<p>In this battle the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> had one officer
and forty-four men killed; four officers and one hundred
and twenty-four men wounded: the strength of the battalion
in the field was seven hundred and twenty-two.</p>

</div>

<p class="p1">Lieut.-General Graham stated, in his public despatch,
“No expressions of mine could do justice to the
conduct of the troops throughout. Nothing less than
the almost unparalleled exertions of every officer, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
invincible bravery of every soldier, and the most determined
devotion to the honor of His Majesty’s arms,
in all, could have achieved this brilliant success,
against such a formidable enemy so posted.”</p>

<p>Among the prisoners were the General of Division
Rufin, the General of Brigade Rousseau; the Chief of
the Staff, General Bellegarde; an Aide-de-camp of Marshal
Victor; the Colonel of the Eighth regiment, and
several other officers. The prisoners amounted to two
general officers, one field officer, nine captains, eight
subalterns, and four hundred and twenty rank and file.
The enemy lost about three thousand men in killed,
wounded, and prisoners, while that of the British
amounted to one thousand two hundred and forty-three
killed and wounded. Six pieces of cannon were also
captured.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Graham, on this glorious occasion,
wrote a short but comprehensive note from the field of
battle, to General Sir John Doyle, the colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment, in these words, congratulating
him on the steadiness and gallantry displayed
by the second battalion in an action which redounded
so much to the fame of the British arms.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“<i>Barrosa, 5th March, 1811.</i></p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">My dear Doyle</span>,</div>

<p>Major Hugh Gough was promoted to the brevet
rank of Lieut.-Colonel, in consequence of Lieut.-General
Graham’s recommendation, for his gallantry at
<i>Barrosa</i>, and also received a medal for that battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>On the 18th of April 1811, His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent was pleased to approve of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
being in future styled “<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>,
<i>or Prince of Wales’s Own Irish Regiment</i>,” and of its
bearing, as a badge of honor, on the regimental colour and
appointments an <i>Eagle</i> with a <i>Wreath of Laurel</i>, above
the <i>Harp</i>, in addition to the arms of His Royal Highness,
in commemoration of the distinguished gallantry
of the second battalion on various occasions, and particularly
at the battle of <i>Barrosa</i> on the 5th of March 1811.</p>

<p>Both Houses of Parliament unanimously voted their
thanks to Lieut.-General Graham, and the officers and
men under his command, for this victory, and their
valour and ability were highly applauded by the nation.</p>

<p>The importance of the victory was fully appreciated
by Lieut.-General Viscount Wellington, K.B., who
in a letter to Lieut.-General Graham, of the 25th of
March, thus expressed himself:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I beg to congratulate you and the brave troops
under your command, on the signal victory which
you gained on the 5th instant. I have no doubt
whatever, that their success would have had the
effect of raising the siege of Cadiz, if the Spanish
corps had made any effort to assist them; and I am
equally certain, from your account of the ground,
that if you had not decided with the utmost promptitude
to attack the enemy, and if your attack had
not been a most vigorous one, the whole allied army
would have been lost.</p>

<p>“You have to regret that such a victory should not
have been followed by all the consequences which
might reasonably be expected from it; but you may
console yourself with the reflection that you did your
utmost, and, at all events, saved the allied army;
and that the failure in the extent of benefit to be derived
from your exertions is to be attributed to those
who would have derived most advantage from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“I concur in the propriety of your withdrawing to
the Isla on the 6th, as much as I admire the promptitude
and determination of your attack of the 5th;
and I most sincerely congratulate you and the brave
troops under your command, on your success.”</p>
</div>


<p>And in a letter of the same date to Marshal Sir
William Carr Beresford, K.B., Viscount Wellington
stated:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“General Graham has returned to the Isla,
after having fought the hardest action that has been
fought yet. The Spaniards left him very much to
his own exertions. The Spanish General is to be
brought to a court-martial.”</p>
</div>


<p>In a letter of the 27th of March to the Earl of Liverpool,
Secretary of State, Lieut.-General Viscount
Wellington expressed similar sentiments to the foregoing,
and added:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am convinced that His Royal Highness the
Prince Regent will duly appreciate the promptitude
with which Lieut.-General Graham decided to attack
the enemy in the important position of which they
had obtained possession; the vigour with which he
carried that decision into execution, and the gallantry
displayed by all the officers and troops upon that
glorious occasion.”</p>
</div>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> having returned to Cadiz,
after the battle of Barrosa, remained there until the
10th of October, when it embarked with a brigade
under the command of Colonel Skerrett, of the Forty-seventh
regiment, and landed at <i>Tarifa</i> on the 15th of
that month. A strong division of the French army,
amounting to ten thousand men, under the immediate
orders of General Laval, invested the town of <i>Tarifa</i>
on the 20th of December 1811. The garrison consisted
of a thousand British, and about seven hundred
Spanish troops, and was commanded by Colonel Skerrett.
In the night of the 29th the enemy fired salvos
of grape on the breach, and on the 30th the breaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
fire was renewed. A heavy rain filled the bed of the
river during the night, and the torrent bringing down
planks, fascines, gabions and dead bodies from the
French camp, broke the palisades, and bent the portcullis
backward. The surge of the waters also injured the
defences behind the breach. After a heavy cannonading
and bombardment, with considerable skirmishing,
a breach in the walls was effected, and preparations
were made for storming on the 31st of December.</p>

<p>The post of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> was at the breach;
and about eight o’clock in the morning of the 31st, the
French troops, amounting to two thousand chosen men,
composed of all the grenadiers and voltigeurs of the
army, advanced thereto, where they were received by
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> with three cheers, the battalion
at the same time pouring in a most tremendous and
well directed fire, which, for a moment, checked the
enemy, who, as if to escape the fire, ran with desperation
towards the breach, which they found impracticable;
they then hurried along the wall, to endeavour
to force the portcullis, but without effect, on which
they fled precipitately to their own lines.</p>

<p>During the attack, the drums and fifes of the regiment
played the favourite Irish airs of <i>Patrick’s Day</i>
and <i>Garryowen</i>, and nothing but the steadiness and discipline
of the corps could have prevented them from
pursuing the enemy.</p>

<p>The following eloquent description of this assault is
given by Lieut.-General Sir William Napier, K.C.B.,
in his History of the Peninsular War.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The waters subsided in the night as quickly as
they had risen, but at daylight a living stream of
French grenadiers glided swiftly down the bed of the
river, and as if assured of victory, arrived, without
shout or tumult, within a few yards of the walls,
when, instead of quitting the hollow, to reach the
breach, they, like the torrent of the night, continued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
their rapid course, and dashed against the portcullis.
The British soldiers who had hitherto been silent and
observant, as if at a spectacle which they were expected
to applaud, now arose, and with a crashing
volley smote the head of the French column. The
leading officer, covered with wounds, fell against the
portcullis, and gave up his sword through the bars to
Colonel Gough. The French drummer, a gallant
boy, who was beating the charge, dropped lifeless by
his officer’s side, and the dead and wounded filled the
hollow. The remainder of the assailants then breaking
out to the right and left, spread along the slopes of
ground under the ramparts, and opened a quick irregular
musketry. At the same time, a number of
men coming out of the trenches, leaped into pits
digged in front, and shot fast at the garrison, but no
escalade or diversion at the other points was made,
and the storming column was dreadfully shattered;
for the ramparts streamed forth fire, and from the
north-eastern tower a field-piece, held in reserve expressly
for the occasion, sent, at pistol-shot distance,
a tempest of grape whistling through the French
masses, which were swept away in such a dreadful
manner, that they could no longer endure the destruction,
but plunging once more into the hollow
returned to their camp, while a shout of victory,
mingled with the sound of musical instruments, passed
round the wall of the town.”</p>
</div>


<p>This gallant affair cost the regiment but little; Lieutenants
M. Carroll and Waller being the only officers
wounded, and a few of the men.</p>

<p>Volunteer William Ireland was promoted to an ensigncy
for his own good conduct and that of the regiment
at the siege of <span class="smcap">Tarifa</span>; and Serjeant Irwin
very much distinguished himself.</p>

<p>The following is the return of killed and wounded in
the action at <i>Tarifa</i> on the 31st of December:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Royal Engineers.</i>—Lieutenant Joseph Longley, killed.</p>

<p><i>Forty-seventh Regiment, Second Battalion.</i>—Lieutenant
Richard Hall and one man killed; Lieutenant
George Hill and two rank and file wounded.</p>

<p><i>Eighty-seventh Regiment, Second Battalion.</i>—Five
rank and file killed; Lieutenant Morgan Carroll, Ensign
Waller, and twenty-one rank and file wounded.</p>

<p><i>Ninety-fifth Regiment, Second Battalion (Rifles.)</i>—One
man killed, and one wounded.</p>

<p><i>Total.</i>—Two officers, and seven rank and file killed:
three officers, and twenty-four rank and file wounded.</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Skerrett, in the evening, issued the following
orders:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Colonel Skerrett most sincerely congratulates the
British garrison on the glorious result of the affair
of to-day. Two thousand of the enemy’s best troops
attacked the breach, and were totally defeated with
immense loss. On our side all behaved nobly; but the
conduct of <i>Lieut.-Colonel Gough</i>, and the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment, surpasses praise.”</p>
</div>

<p>The situation of the enemy’s wounded, with which
the ground was covered between his battery and the
British fire, where they must have inevitably perished,
induced Colonel Skerrett, from motives of compassion,
to hoist a flag of truce to carry them off. Some were
brought into the place over the breach; but from the
extreme difficulty attending this, the French were allowed
to carry the remainder away. General Laval
expressed his acknowledgment of the conduct of the
British and Spanish nations on this occasion in the
most feeling and grateful terms. The enemy’s loss
was very severe, and ten officers were amongst the
prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1812.</div>

<p>From the movements of the enemy on the 4th of
January 1812, it was supposed that another assault was
intended, and the garrison waited in eager expectation
to display another proof of British valour. On the
following morning, at daylight, the columns of the
enemy were already at a distance, having taken advantage
of a dark and stormy night to make a precipitate
retreat, leaving in the possession of the British all
his artillery, ammunition, and stores. Marshal Victor
was present in the French camp to give orders for the
retreat. Major Richard Broad, with a part of the Forty-seventh
regiment, was immediately ordered to follow
the enemy, and he took possession of the artillery,
waggons, and a quantity of stores in sufficient time to
save them from the flames, the French having set fire
to them. Some prisoners were made on this occasion.
In an intercepted despatch from Marshal Soult, three
months after the siege, it was stated,—“The taking of
Tarifa will be more hurtful to the English and to
the defenders of Cadiz, than the taking of Alicant or
even Badajoz, where I cannot go without first securing
my left and taking Tarifa.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The royal authority was afterwards granted for the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Tarifa</span>” on the
regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of the distinguished gallantry of the second battalion
in successfully defending the breach at that place against
a very superior French force on the 31st of December
1811.</p>

<p>Four companies being left in Tarifa, the six companies
returned to Cadiz, the siege of which place
having been raised, the six companies marched in
August 1812 with other corps from Cadiz, and occupied
Seville, where they were shortly joined by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
four companies from Tarifa. The battalion quitted
Seville on the 30th of September, in order to join the
army under the Marquis of Wellington, to which it
was transferred on the first of October 1812.</p>

<p>The battalion proceeded to join the fourth division
of the Peninsular army at Aranjuez, near Madrid, on
the 25th of October. On the morning of the 31st, at
eight o’clock, the advanced guard of Marshal Soult,
consisting of nine thousand men, attacked the passage
of the bridge and fort of <i>Puerto Largo</i>, several times
during the day, but was defeated with considerable
loss.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment
on this occasion behaved with great gallantry, and,
continuing its march to Madrid, reached it that night,
but, on the following one, commenced its retreat to Salamanca,
during which the rear-guard, being formed by the
third brigade, of which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> then composed
a part, was, on the 16th of November, attacked
several times by the enemy’s cavalry. In the end of December,
the regiment arrived at Salamanca, having lost
during the retreat to Portugal, two officers, namely, Ensigns
De Courcy Ireland and William Ireland, eight Serjeants,
two drummers, and one hundred and eighty-two
rank and file, by disease caused by fatigue and extreme
bad weather. It rained continually for three days and
nights, during which the regiment had no tents to
cover them. The men were obliged to sit down in
line each night to receive the enemy.</p>

<p>Serjeants Coppin, M’Mahon, Milligan, O’Hara, and
Palmer, were promoted to be ensigns after the retreat,
on account of the good conduct of the regiment.</p>

<p>A striking instance of intrepidity and presence of
mind occurred on one of those marches in the Peninsula,
which so frequently terminated in a general action.
During a short halt, the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> took up its
ground upon a hill not far from the enemy, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
men were sitting down to rest, when a howitzer, that
had been masked, opened upon them; some shells fell
short, but one alighted in the centre of one of the companies.
The men naturally endeavoured to get out of
its reach, when James Geraghty, a private grenadier,
called out to the men, “that he would show them how
they played foot-ball at Limerick;” and immediately
kicked the live shell, with its burning fuse, over the
edge of the hill: the moment it touched the ground it
exploded without injuring a man of the regiment. For
this gallant act the commanding officer made the man a
handsome present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813.</div>

<p>The army took the field in 1813, and arrived in the
neighbourhood of <i>Vittoria</i> on the 18th of June, and on
the 21st of that month the regiment was engaged with
the French army until dark, when the enemy was
routed with immense loss; one hundred and fifty-one
pieces of artillery, a stand of colours, with all his
baggage, falling into the hands of the victors.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> formed part of the third
division; the Marquis of Wellington ordered that an
attack should be made on three separate points; on
the right by Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, with
the second division, upon the French left at Puebla;
while on the left, Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham,
with the first and fifth divisions, was to make a wide
detour to the left, and crossing the Zadorra at <i>Vittoria</i>
to attack their right, and cut off their retreat by the
great road to Bayonne. The centre, consisting of the
fourth and light divisions (under the Marquis of
Wellington himself) on the right, and the third and
seventh (under Lieut.-General the Earl of Dalhousie)
on the left, were to pass the bridges in front, and
attack as soon as the movements on the flanks should
be executed. The difficult nature of the country prevented
the communication between the different
columns moving to the attack from their stations on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the river Bayas, at as early an hour as was expected.
The fourth and light divisions, however, passed the
Zadorra immediately after Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill had obtained possession of Subijana de Alava;
and almost as soon as these had crossed, the column
under the Earl of Dalhousie arrived at Mendoza. The
third division, under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas
Picton, crossed at the bridge higher up, followed by
the seventh division under the Earl of Dalhousie.
The seventh division, and the centre brigade of the
third division, then attacked the French right centre,
in front of the villages of Margarita and Hermandad;
and the Marquis of Wellington, seeing the hill in front
of the village of Arinez weakly occupied by the enemy,
ordered the right brigade of the third division, under
Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Picton, in close columns of
battalions, at a run diagonally across the front of both
armies, to that central point. The hill was carried
immediately, and the French withdrew, under cover
of a cannonade from fifty pieces of artillery and a crowd
of skirmishers, to the second range of heights on
which their reserve had been posted; they, however,
still held the village of Arinez, on the great road leading
to Vittoria. The brigade then advanced to the
attack of the village of Arinez, and the French were
finally driven back in confusion at the point of the
bayonet. These four divisions, forming the centre of
the army, were destined to attack the height on which
the right of the enemy’s centre was placed, while
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill should move forward
from Subijana de Alava to attack the left. The enemy,
however, having weakened his line to strengthen his
detachment on the hills, abandoned his position in the
valley as soon as he saw the British position to attack
it, and ultimately commenced his retreat in good order
towards Vittoria.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulty of the ground, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
allied troops continued to advance in admirable order.
Other movements took place, the result of which terminated
in a complete victory. King Joseph, whose
carriage and court equipage were seized, had barely
time to escape on horseback. The defeat was the most
complete that the French had sustained in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Wellington, in his despatch, stated
that “Major-General the Honorable Charles Colville’s
brigade of the third division was seriously attacked in
its advance by a very superior force well formed,
which it drove in, supported by General Inglis’s
brigade of the seventh division, commanded by Colonel
Grant, of the Eighty-second. <i>These officers and the
troops under their command distinguished themselves.</i>”</p>

<p>In this conflict the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, under Lieut.-Colonel
Gough, had the honor of taking the bâton
of Marshal Jourdan. The circumstance was thus
alluded to upon the Marquis of Wellington being
appointed a Field Marshal. In a most flattering letter,
the Prince Regent, in the name and behalf of His
Majesty, thus conferred the honor:—“<ins class="corr" id="tn-62" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Your have sent me'">
You have sent me</ins> among the trophies of your unrivalled fame the
staff of a French Marshal, and I send you in return
that of England.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> had one ensign, four serjeants,
and eighty-three rank and file killed; three
captains, four lieutenants, two ensigns, seven serjeants,
two drummers, and one hundred and forty-eight rank
and file wounded, making a total of two hundred and
fifty-four. The strength of the battalion in the field was
six hundred and thirty-seven.</p>

in this battle.</p>

<p>Volunteer O’Grady, and Serjeant-Major Wallace,
were promoted for their good conduct; and Lieutenant
and Adjutant Moore had two horses shot under him in
this battle.</p>

<p>The army pursued the French, who, after throwing
in reinforcements into the fortress of <i>Pampeluna</i>, continued
their retreat. Being reinforced, and Marshal
Soult, who had been selected by Napoleon for the command
of the French army in Spain, with the rank of
“Lieutenant of the Emperor,” having arrived, they
forced the British to retire on a position in the Spanish
range of the Pyrenees; when the brigade, in which
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> was placed, held the right
of the position from the 27th of July to the 1st of
August, during which the enemy twice made demonstrations
of attack. The French being defeated on the
1st of August, retreated and took up and fortified a
position in their own territories; the British pursued
through the famous pass of Roncesvalles, and on the
8th of August 1813, first came in view of France, and
entered its territories on the 10th of November, having
during the intermediate period being engaged in skirmishes,
in which a few were killed and wounded.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November the British troops were
engaged at the <i>Nivelle</i>, from five o’clock in the morning
until dark, meeting with a most obstinate resistance in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
an entrenched camp. The gallantry of the allies, however,
drove the French to Saint Jean de Luz. The
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> on this occasion called forth from
Major-General the Honorable Charles Colville, who
commanded the division, and Colonel John Keane
(afterwards Lieut.-General Lord Keane), who commanded
the brigade, the most animated praises. One
ensign, six serjeants, one drummer, and sixty-eight
rank and file, were killed; one lieut.-colonel, four lieutenants,
eleven serjeants, one drummer, and one hundred
and twenty-three rank and file, wounded. Total, two

and appointments, by royal authority, is commemorative
of the gallantry of the second battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> on this occasion.</p>

<p>During the remaining part of the year, the regiment
was frequently engaged with the enemy in
skirmishes.</p>

<p>Private Robert Smith, of the Grenadiers, was, at
the request of Sir Charles Colville, promoted to be
serjeant for his gallantry.</p>

<p>Volunteers Bourne and Bagenall, who were attached
to the light company, were both severely
wounded, and promoted to be ensigns for their gallant
conduct. Serjeant Prideaux, of the light company,
also distinguished himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1814.</div>

<p>In 1814 the army, strengthened by recruits and
recovered men, continued its march into France, and
on the 24th of February arrived at Salvatira.</p>

<p>The light company was engaged with those of the
brigade, when a much superior force of the enemy
attacked them; the light companies were in consequence
recalled, and the brigade brought down to
cover their retreat. On this occasion two rank and file
were killed; Lieutenants Joseph Barry and William
Wolsley Lanphier, with nine rank and file, wounded;
and Lieutenant George Jackson taken prisoner.</p>

<p>On the 25th of February the regiment crossed the
ford, attacked the French at <i>Orthes</i> on the 27th, and
drove them from their entrenchments with immense
loss. In this action the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment drew from the general officers in
command the greatest praises for its bravery. It had
one lieutenant, five serjeants, and eighty-seven rank
and file killed; one major, four lieutenants, eight serjeants,
and one hundred and fifty-eight rank and file
wounded: total, two hundred and sixty-four. The
strength in the field was five hundred and fifty-one.</p>

<p>The royal authority was afterwards granted for the

the regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of the second battalion having shared in this
battle.</p>

<p>During the night of the 11th of April the French
troops evacuated <i>Toulouse</i>, and a white flag was hoisted.
On the following day the Marquis of Wellington
entered the city amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants.
In the course of the afternoon of the 12th of
April intelligence was received of the abdication of
Napoleon; and had not the express been delayed on the
journey by the French police, the sacrifice of many
valuable lives would have been prevented.</p>

<p>A disbelief in the truth of this intelligence occasioned
much unnecessary bloodshed at <i>Bayonne</i>, the garrison
of which made a desperate <i>sortie</i> on the 14th of April,
and Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards Earl of
Hopetoun) was taken prisoner, Major-General Andrew
Hay was killed, and Major-General Stopford was
wounded. This was the last action of the Peninsular
war.</p>

<p>A Treaty of Peace was established between Great
Britain and France; Louis XVIII. was restored to the
throne of his ancestors, and Napoleon Bonaparte was
permitted to reside at Elba, the sovereignty of that
island having been conceded to him by the allied powers.</p>

<p>Prior to the breaking up of the Peninsular army, the
Duke of Wellington issued the following general order:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“<i>Bordeaux, 14th June 1814.</i></p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">General Order.</span></div>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces, being upon the
point of returning to England, again takes this opportunity
of congratulating the army upon the recent
events which have restored peace to their country and
to the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“The share which the British army have had in producing
those events, and the high character with which
the army will quit this country, must be equally satisfactory
to every individual belonging to it, as they
are to the Commander of the Forces, and he trusts
that the troops will continue the same good conduct to
the last.</p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces once more requests
the army to accept his thanks.</p>

<p>“Although circumstances may alter the relations in
which he has stood towards them for some years so
much to his satisfaction, he assures them he will never
cease to feel the warmest interest in their welfare and
honor, and that he will be at all times happy to be of
any service to those to whose conduct, discipline, and
gallantry their country is so much indebted.”</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to the other distinctions acquired during
the war in the Peninsula and the south of France, the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> received the royal authority to bear
the word “<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>” on the regimental colour and
appointments.</p>

<p>The war being ended, the battalion marched from
Toulouse to Blanchfort, and embarked at Pouillac on
the 7th of July, and arrived at Cork on the 20th of
that month.</p>

<p>After being inspected, on landing at Cork, by the
General commanding the district, the battalion was
marched to Mallow to relieve the Twentieth regiment.
It subsequently marched to the city of Limerick, and
was stationed there for a few days, when orders were
received for it to proceed to Middleton, in the county of
Cork, to await the arrival of transports.</p>

<p>The battalion embarked at the Cove of Cork on the
23rd of August, and landed at Portsmouth, after a
protracted voyage, on the 14th of September. On the
day of disembarkation it proceeded <i>en route</i> to Horsham,
where the depôt of the regiment was stationed. After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
a stay of some days at Horsham, it marched to Plymouth
for garrison duty, where it remained until
December, having taken its tour of a month’s duty over
the American prisoners of war at Dartmoor.</p>

<p>On the 6th of December 1814 the battalion embarked
for Guernsey, of which island General Sir John Doyle,
Bart., the Colonel of the regiment, was Governor, and
where it arrived on the 8th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1816.</div>

<p>The battalion continued on duty at Guernsey until
the 2nd of April 1816, when it embarked for Portsmouth,
from whence it marched to Colchester in September
following.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1817.</div>

<p>On the 25th of January 1817, in pursuance of
measures being taken for the reduction of the army,
orders were received for the disbandment of the second
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment, on which
occasion Lieut.-Colonel Sir Hugh Gough issued the
following orders:—</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
“<i>Colchester Barracks, 24th January, 1817.</i></p>

<div>“<span class="smcap">Regimental Orders.</span></div>

<p>“It is with the most painful feeling of regret
Lieut.-Colonel Sir Hugh Gough is necessitated to
announce to the second battalion, <i>Prince’s Own Irish</i>,
that their services as a corps are no longer required,
in consequence of the military arrangements it has
been found necessary to adopt.</p>

<p>“In making this distressing though necessary communication,
and in taking leave of those brave officers
and men, at whose head it has been Sir Hugh Gough’s
good fortune so long to have been placed, he feels
himself on this occasion called upon to recapitulate
the leading ones of so many brilliant achievements
performed by his gallant comrades now about to
separate. The recollection of such scenes must be a
source of gratification to all, whether called on to
serve their country in India, or to retire to their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
families and native land. To their Commanding Officer
it ever has and ever will be, a source of heartfelt
exultation. By their country and by their illustrious
master, their services have been duly appreciated,
and nobly rewarded by that designation, and by those
badges so peculiar, so honorable, and so gratifying.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> had the good fortune to
serve under the first General of the age, throughout
the greater part of the Peninsular war, and longer
than most corps in the service. At the battle of
<i>Talavera</i> on the 27th of July, 1809 (when the battalion
first encountered the enemy), they had to
sustain unsupported the repeated attacks of the advance
corps, and did not retire until both flanks were
turned, the battalion nearly surrounded by an infinitely
superior force, and two-thirds of the officers
and men either killed or wounded. The movement
of the regiment to the rear, and its formation on the
other corps of the division, was a counterpart of their
conduct, in having instantly recovered, on the first
attack of the enemy, a temporary confusion which
was occasioned by the fire of a British regiment into
the rear of the battalion, the thickness of the wood
having made it impossible for that distinguished corps
to have perceived the new position which the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
had taken up.</p>

<p>“On this memorable occasion the charge of the two
centre companies did them and their officers the
greatest honor. The gallantry of the whole was conspicuous,
and obtained the personal thanks of the
brave officer who commanded the division<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, and who
unfortunately fell on the following day, and also
the repeated thanks of the officer commanding the
brigade.</p>

<p>“At the brilliant action of <i>Barrosa</i> the conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> in taking up the first position
under a most destructive fire from the enemy’s artillery,
and a column three times its numbers, when
it formed with the precision of parade movements,
gave a happy omen of the issue of the day. The
advance of the battalion in line, its volley into the
two battalions of the eighth, and its charge on that
corps, called for and received the proudest meed of
gallantry, the enthusiastic approbation of such an
officer as Sir Thomas Graham.</p>

<p>“This charge was rewarded by the wreathed eagle
of the eighth French regiment, and a howitzer: it
led in a great measure to the total discomfiture of the
right column under General Laval, and nearly annihilated
two battalions of one of the finest regiments in the
French army: of one thousand six hundred men, which
they brought into the field, only three hundred and
fifty returned to Chiclana. The ready formation of
the right wing from amidst the ranks of the retreating
enemy, and their charge on the fifty-fourth French
regiment, which at this moment attacked the right of
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, was rewarded by the marked
approbation of their esteemed chief. The ultimate
advance of the battalion on the enemy’s guns was
equally praiseworthy.</p>

<p>“At <i>Tarifa</i>, a species of service new to the British
army called for a renewal of that steady gallantry
which marked the conduct of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
at Barrosa. The immense superiority, in number, of
the enemy, added enthusiasm to discipline: the cool
intrepidity, the strict observance of orders, the exulting
cheer when the enemy’s columns pressed
forward to the attack, proved the feelings which
influenced the defenders of the breach of <i>Tarifa</i>, and
was as honorable to them as soldiers, as their humane
conduct to the wounded (when the enemy fled) was
to their characters as men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“The persevering attention to their duty on the
walls, in conjunction with their brave comrades, the
second battalion of the Forty-seventh, exposed to the
continued fire of an enemy ten times the number of
the garrison, and to the most dreadfully inclement
weather, led to the ultimate abandonment of the
siege, and was rewarded by the approbation of their
General, their Prince, and their Country.</p>

<p>“The battle of <i>Vittoria</i> renewed the claim the
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> had to a place in the third division,
and under its lamented leader<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the battalion acquired
fresh laurels. The charge of the Prince’s Own on the
hill crowned with the enemy’s artillery, and covered
with a strong column, called forth the marked approbation
of Major-General the Honorable Charles Colville,
as did the pursuit of that column, though flanked
by a corps greatly superior in numbers. The cool
steadiness with which they preserved their second
position, under the fire and within a short range of a
large portion of the enemy’s field artillery, although
the battalion at this time had lost upwards of half
the number it took into the field, showed the steady
perseverance in bravery and discipline which ever
marked the glorious career of the corps.</p>

<p>“The attack on the fortified hill at the action of the
<i>Nivelle</i>, and the gallantry which rendered the conduct
of the battalion so conspicuous in the subsequent attacks
on that day, called for those animated expressions
from Major-General the Honorable Charles Colville
and Colonel John Keane, who commanded the division
and brigade, ‘Gallant <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>!’ ‘Noble
<span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>!’ and deservedly were those titles
bestowed.</p>

<p>“The actions of <i>Orthes</i> and <i>Toulouse</i> were also most
glorious to the character of the corps, and its conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
was rewarded by the repeated thanks of the Generals
commanding.</p>

<p>“Since the return of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> from
service, they have shown, that to gallantry in the
field, they add the most essential requisite in a soldier,
<i>orderly and correct conduct in garrison</i>, which has
acquired for them the approbation of every general
officer under whom they have served, and the good
wishes and esteem of the inhabitants with whom they
have been placed.</p>

<p>“While the foregoing detail will be most gratifying
to the gallant men who have survived, the recital
must also be consoling to the families of those who fell.
The <i>Prince’s Own Irish</i> bled prodigally and nobly;
they have sealed their duty to their King and country
by the sacrifice of nearly two thousand of their comrades.
But, while Lieut.-Colonel Sir Hugh Gough
feels an honest pride in recounting these achievements,
he wishes to caution his brother soldiers from
assuming any exclusive right to pre-eminence over
their gallant comrades; the Army of the Peninsula
nobly did their duty, and repeatedly received the
thanks of their Prince and their country.</p>

<p>“In parting with the remains of that corps in which
Sir Hugh Gough has served twenty-two years, at the
head of which, and by whose valour and discipline, he
has obtained those marks of distinction with which he
has been honored by his Royal Master, he cannot too
emphatically express the most heartfelt acknowledgments
and his deep regret.</p>

<p>“From all classes of his officers he has uniformly
experienced the most cordial and ready support.
Their conduct in the field, while it called for the entire
approbation of their Commanding Officer, acquired
for them the best stay to military enterprise and military
renown, <i>the confidence of their men</i>, and led to the
accomplishment of their wishes, the Approbation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
their Prince, the Honor of their country, and the
Character of their Corps. Every non-commissioned
officer and man is equally entitled to the thanks of
his Commanding Officer. To all he feels greatly
indebted, and he begs to assure all, that their prosperity
as individuals, or as a corps, will ever be the
first wish of his heart, and to promote which he will
consider no sacrifice or exertion too great.”</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Sir John Doyle, Bart., G.C.B. and K.C.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Appointed 3rd May 1796.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">This officer was descended from an ancient Irish family, and
was born at Dublin in the year 1756. He was at first intended
for the law, which, on the death of his father, he
relinquished for the military profession, and was appointed
Ensign in the Forty-eighth regiment on the 21st of March
1771, in which he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant
on the 17th of September 1773, and was wounded while on
duty in Ireland. Lieutenant Doyle exchanged to the Fortieth
regiment on the 1st of March 1775, and embarked with
that corps for North America in the same year. During
the War of Independence in that country he served with his
regiment in the descent on Long Island in August 1776, and
was present at the actions of Brooklyn, White Plains (28th
of October), Fort Washington, Haerlem Creek, Springfield,
and Iron Hills. In the action at Brooklyn, on the 27th of
August, Lieutenant Doyle was brought into notice by conduct
which combined the best feelings with the most animated
courage. He was Adjutant of the Fortieth, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Grant, who was regarded as a father by the
younger portion of the corps. The Lieut.-Colonel was
desperately wounded early in the action, which becoming
very hot where he lay, Lieutenant Doyle, fearing he might
be trampled to death, rushed with a few followers into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
midst of the enemy, and dragged away the body of his
friend; but it was too late, for he had expired. This act
made a strong impression on all who witnessed it, and produced
a handsome compliment from the Commander-in-Chief,
General the Honorable Sir William Howe.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Doyle was present at the action of Brandywine,
fought on the 11th of September 1777, which was followed
by the capture of Philadelphia. He shared in the surprise
of General Wayne’s corps during the night of the 20th of
September, and was again wounded at the battle of Germantown
on the 4th of October. In the latter the Fortieth
regiment highly distinguished itself by the defence of Chew’s
Stone House, which was occupied under the following circumstances:—About
three weeks after the affair of Brandywine,
when the American troops were supposed to be totally
dispersed, General Washington made a movement with the
intention of surprising the British at Germantown. The
advanced post of the British army was occupied by a battalion
of light infantry and the Fortieth regiment, then
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Musgrove. These troops
were attacked about daybreak on the 4th of October by the
main body of the American army, commanded by General
Washington in person. After a very spirited defence they
were obliged to give way to numbers, and to retire towards
Germantown. In this retreat Colonel Musgrove took possession
of a large stone house, with such of the regiment as
were nearest to it. This small body, not exceeding five
officers and about one hundred and fifty men, stopped the
progress of the enemy’s whole column, consisting of five
thousand men, for a considerable time, notwithstanding
cannon being brought to bear upon the house. This gallant
defence was highly instrumental in saving the British army.
In this affair Lieutenant Doyle and two officers were
wounded. For this service the detachment was honored
with His Majesty’s particular thanks.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1778, General the Honorable Sir William
Howe, K.B., returned to England, and the command of the
army in North America devolved on General Sir Henry
Clinton, K.B. The next action in which Lieutenant Doyle
shared was that at Monmouth Court-House on the 28th of
June 1778, and on the 24th of October following he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
promoted to a company in the corps raised by Lord Rawdon
(afterwards Marquis of Hastings), which was at first named
the “<i>Volunteers of Ireland</i>,” but which was subsequently
numbered the One hundred and fifth regiment. Shortly
after General Sir Henry Clinton assumed the chief command,
it was deemed a measure of policy to withdraw from
the ranks of the enemy the natives of Scotland and Ireland.
Two regiments were raised by distinguished noblemen
of these countries; one was designated the “<i>Caledonian
Volunteers</i>,” and the other the “<i>Volunteers of Ireland</i>.”
The former was given to Lord Cathcart, and the
latter to Lord Rawdon, then Adjutant-General in America.
The officers were chosen from the line, and Lieutenant
Doyle obtained a company as above stated.</p>

<p>In the celebrated retreat through the Jerseys, Captain
Doyle acted as Major of Brigade. During the winter of
1779 his regiment was ordered to South Carolina, under
the command of Lord Rawdon, where he assisted at the
siege of Charleston. After the fall of this place in May
1780, Captain Doyle accompanied Lieut.-General the Earl
Cornwallis up the country, by whom he was appointed
Major of Brigade, and was honorably mentioned in his
Lordship’s despatch relative to the action at Camden, which
was fought on the 16th of August 1780.</p>

<p>Upon Lord Cornwallis quitting the province of South
Carolina, Captain Doyle served in the same capacity to
Colonel Lord Rawdon, who succeeded to the command of
this portion of the troops, and soon had another opportunity
of distinguishing himself. General Green, having contrived
after the battle of Guildford, on the 15th of March 1781, to
turn Lord Cornwallis’s left, by a rapid movement penetrated
the upper parts of South Carolina, and presented himself
before the village of Camden, where Lord Rawdon commanded
a small detachment, not exceeding nine hundred
men, while the enemy’s force consisted of three thousand
regulars, a fine corps of cavalry, and a numerous body of
militia, strongly posted on the heights above the village
in which the British were quartered. His Lordship seeing
the difficulty of a retreat, boldly determined to advance
against the enemy. Accordingly on the 25th of April 1781,
he chose the hour of mid-day to make his attempt, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
least expected, his march being concealed by a circuitous
route through thick woods. This sudden and rapid
manœuvre enabled his Lordship to reach Hobkirk Hill
before General Green became aware of the movement,
and the British gained a complete victory. The exertions
of Brigade-Major Doyle on this well-fought field were
alluded to in highly honorable terms in his Lordship’s despatch.
Having raised the siege of Ninety-six, Lord Rawdon
returned to England on account of ill health, when the
Brigade-Major prepared to join the Earl Cornwallis in
Virginia; but in consequence of the effects of the action
at Ewtaw Springs on the 8th of September 1781, he was
requested, from his knowledge of the country, to remain in
the province to fill a more prominent situation. He subsequently
acted as Adjutant-General and Public Secretary
to Colonel Paston Gould; and on that officer’s decease in the
following year, he was honored with the same confidence by
his successors, Major-General James Stuart and Lieut.-General
the Honorable Alexander Leslie.</p>

<p>Captain Doyle was promoted on the 21st of March 1782
to the rank of Major in the “Volunteers of Ireland,” which
corps at this period was numbered the One hundred and
fifth regiment. Major Doyle formed a corps of light
cavalry from amongst the backwoodsmen, with which he
rendered essential service to the army, and was again
severely wounded. In the expedition against General Marion
he charged the State regiment of Carolina dragoons with his
advanced corps of seventy horse, the killed, wounded, and
prisoners of the enemy exceeding his whole force. The
American War shortly afterwards terminated, and the One
hundred and <ins class="corr" id="tn-78" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'fith regiment was'">
fifth regiment was</ins> ordered to Ireland, when
Major Doyle was entrusted with public despatches to the
ministers.</p>

<p>Peace having now taken place, Major Doyle entered upon
a new scene of action, and was returned member for Mullingar
in the Irish parliament of 1782, when his exertions
were devoted to the improvement of the establishment in
Ireland, similar to Chelsea Hospital, for the relief of disabled
and worn-out soldiers. The One hundred and fifth
regiment was disbanded in 1784, and Major Doyle remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
on half-pay from the 25th of June of that year until the war
of the French Revolution in 1793, when he offered to raise
a regiment of his countrymen for the service of Government;
and his Royal Patron honored the corps with the
appellation of “The Prince of Wales’s Irish Regiment,”
and it was numbered the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, of which Major
Doyle was appointed Lieut.-Colonel Commandant on the
18th of September 1793, and with which he proceeded in
the following year to the Continent, with the force commanded
by Major-General the Earl of Moira, under whom
(as Lord Rawdon) he had served in America.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Doyle served during the campaign of 1794
under His Royal Highness the Duke of York, and repulsed
an attack of the enemy at Alost, on the 15th of July of that
year, after having been twice severely wounded, being the
first individual of the regiment who was wounded. His
conduct was honorably noticed in His Royal Highness’s
despatch. Lieut.-Colonel Doyle next proceeded to Antwerp,
and ultimately to England for the recovery of his wounds,
when he was afterwards appointed Secretary-at-War in
Ireland.</p>

<p>In consequence of the reduction of the Prince of Wales’s
household, Lieut.-Colonel Doyle lost the appointment of
Secretary to His Royal Highness; but, notwithstanding this
decrease of income, he closed his political career by a mark
of generosity worthy of being recorded. His regiment being
still prisoners in France, under the circumstances narrated
at page 6., he collected their wives and families, and distributed
five hundred pounds amongst them.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May 1796, Lieut.-Colonel Doyle was promoted
to be Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> regiment, and
proceeded in the command of a secret expedition to Holland,
with the rank of Brigadier-General; but contrary winds,
violent gales, and unavoidable delays, rendered the expedition
fruitless, its object being to surprise and destroy
the Dutch fleet in the Helder.</p>

<p>In 1797 Colonel Doyle was appointed a Brigadier-General
upon the staff, and was ordered to Gibraltar, where he
remained until the expedition was determined on for Malta
and Egypt, when, having volunteered his services, he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
placed on the staff under General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
whom he accompanied to Minorca, Malta, and Cadiz, and
was selected as one of his brigadier-generals upon the
expedition to Egypt, when he shared in the actions, near
Alexandria, of the 8th, 13th, and 21st of March 1801, after
which he was selected by Lieut.-General Hutchinson, who
succeeded to the command on the death of General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, to accompany him in the expedition
against Grand Cairo. He was also at the affair of Rhamanie
on the 9th of May, subsequently to which the army halted
at the village of Algam. On the morning of the 17th of
May, when the army was encamped upon the borders of the
Lybian Desert, an Arab was conducted to Brigadier-General
Doyle’s tent, who brought intelligence that a body of French
troops, which he computed at two thousand men, was within
a few miles of the camp, with a large convoy of camels.
Brigadier-General Doyle immediately requested permission
to pursue the enemy with such of the cavalry as might
be in the camp; and Lieut.-General Hutchinson acceding
to his request, he repaired thither, where he ascertained
that the Turkish cavalry had been detached a day or two
before, and that a squadron of the Twelfth light dragoons
had, prior to his arrival, been sent to water at some distance.
As success depended on promptness and expedition,
the Brigadier immediately struck into the desert in search
of the enemy, without waiting for the absent squadron,
which he left to an officer to bring on. After a long pursuit,
the cavalry came up with the French troops, when they
formed a hollow square, and commenced an irregular fire
of musketry. The French commander, after some parley,
was obliged to surrender on the terms offered; twenty-eight
officers, five hundred and sixty-nine rank and file, two hundred
horses, four hundred and sixty camels, one four-pounder,
besides a stand of colours, were taken on this
occasion by the detachment under Brigadier-General Doyle,
which consisted of two hundred and fifty dragoons.</p>

<p>After the capitulation of Grand Cairo in June 1801,
Lieut.-General Hutchinson (afterwards the Earl of Donoughmore)
in his public despatches, expressed his obligations
to Major-General Cradock and Brigadier-General Doyle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
and recommended them as “officers highly deserving His
Majesty’s favour.” Upon the surrender of Cairo, the
country fever seized many of the troops, and Brigadier-General
Doyle, with several others, was sent ill to Rosetta,
where, before his recovery, he heard a rumour of an intended
attack upon the French at Alexandria. Urged by
this intelligence, he left his sick bed, mounted his horse,
and rode forty miles through the desert, under the intense
heat of an Egyptian sun, and arrived the night before the
attack. In that successful enterprise he commanded, and
had the good fortune to defeat the attempts subsequently
made by General Menou upon a part of his position.
Lieut.-General Hutchinson, on the following day, thanked
him publicly in the field in the most animated manner; but
in writing his official despatch, not only omitted to forward
the Brigadier-General’s report of the action of the Green
Hills, near Alexandria, on the 17th of August 1801, but
unfortunately stated his brigade to have been commanded by
another. This omission was afterwards fully rectified by the
Lieut.-General, and the matter was adverted to by Lord
Hobart in the House of Commons, who particularly alluded
to the conduct of Brigadier-General Doyle, when moving
the thanks of Parliament to the army and navy employed in
Egypt.</p>

<p>While at Naples, after the close of the Egyptian campaign,
whither Brigadier-General Doyle had proceeded for the
recovery of his health, he was requested by the British
ambassador to become the bearer of important despatches
to the Government. This proved a service of great danger,
as the country through which he passed was infested with
banditti, who robbed and assassinated all who fell into their
hands. His conduct on this occasion was gratefully acknowledged
by His Majesty’s ministers. Upon his arrival in
England, he was promoted to the rank of Major-General on
the 29th of April 1802, and was placed on the staff at
Guernsey, and was soon afterwards appointed Lieut.-Governor
of that island, where his services during the
threatened invasion of England by Napoleon were highly
appreciated. Shortly afterwards the island of Alderney was
added to his command. In October 1805, he was created a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Baronet of the United Kingdom, and received His Majesty’s
royal license to wear the Order of the Crescent conferred
by the Grand Seignior, and to bear supporters to his arms,
with an additional crest. On the 25th of April 1808, he
was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-General.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Doyle was selected to organise and
command the Portuguese army, but the despatch ordering him
to report himself for that purpose to the Secretary of State,
was prevented from reaching him by a gale of wind that
lasted for twenty-eight days, and another officer was consequently
sent upon that service, which did not admit of
delay. In 1812 he was nominated a Knight of the Bath,
and in 1815 became a Knight Grand Cross of that Order.</p>

<p>Whilst the Sovereign and the Government were thus
marking their approbation of the services of Lieut.-General
Sir John Doyle, the inhabitants of Guernsey, whose government
he had so long administered, were not slow in manifesting
their gratitude for the benefits they derived from his
fostering care. The States of the Island voted him an
address of thanks under their great seal, and presented him
with a splendid piece of plate, in the form of a vase, with
suitable inscriptions; their example was followed by the
militia and other public bodies with similar valuable and
elegant testimonials; and when he was recalled in consequence
of the reduction of the staff on the peace of 1815,
they unanimously petitioned the Prince Regent that they
might retain their Lieutenant-Governor, and voted the
erection of a pillar, at the public expense, as a memorial of
their gratitude for the services rendered by him to the island
and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Doyle, Bart., was appointed
Governor of Charlemont on the 21st of September 1818,
and on the 12th of August of the following year he was
advanced to the rank of General. His decease occurred in
London, on the 8th of August 1834, after a lengthened service
of sixty-three years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="p2 center" id="SC2"><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Reynell, Bart., K.C.B.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Appointed 15th August 1834.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">This distinguished officer commenced his military career as
an Ensign in the Thirty-eighth regiment, his commission being
dated the 30th of September 1793. He joined the regiment
in January 1794, at Belfast, and in April proceeded with it
to Flanders, where it formed part of the army commanded
by His Royal Highness the Duke of York. On arrival at
the seat of war, the Thirty-eighth regiment was ordered to
join the corps under the Austrian General Count Clèrfait,
who commanded the troops in West Flanders, and it was
attached to the division under Major-General Hammerstein,
together with the Eighth light dragoons and Twelfth foot.
Ensign Reynell was present in the action on the heights of
Lincelles on the 18th of May, and at the battle of Hoglade
on the 13th of June 1794. He afterwards served with the
army under the Duke of York, and was in Nimeguen when
that town was besieged. On the 3rd of December following,
when cantoned between the rivers Rhine and the Waal, he
was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in the Thirty-eighth
regiment. Lieutenant Reynell served during the winter
campaign of 1795, and the retreat through Westphalia to the
Weser, and there embarked for England. He accompanied
the Thirty-eighth regiment to the West Indies in May 1796,
and was present at the capture of the island of Trinidad in
the early part of 1797. On the 22nd of July 1797 he was
promoted to a company in the Second West India regiment,
and joined that corps at Grenada.</p>

<p>Captain Reynell quitted Grenada early in 1798, in consequence
of being appointed Assistant Adjutant-General at
St. Domingo, where he remained until that island was evacuated
by the British in September, when he returned to
England. In the beginning of 1799 he revisited St. Domingo,
as one of the suite of Brigadier-General the Honorable
Thomas Maitland, then employed in framing a commercial
treaty with the negro chief Toussaint L’Ouverture, who had
risen to the supreme authority at St. Domingo. When it was
concluded, Captain Reynell returned to England in July of
the same year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>On the 8th of August 1799 Captain Reynell was transferred
to a company in the Fortieth regiment, with the first
battalion of which he embarked for the Helder in that
month, and joined the army, which was at first commanded
by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, and afterwards
by the Duke of York. Captain Reynell was present in the
action of the 10th of September; also in the battle of the
19th of September, when he was the only captain of the
first battalion of the Fortieth regiment that was not killed or
wounded; he was also present in the subsequent battles of
the 2nd and 6th of October. Captain Reynell, upon the
British army being withdrawn from Holland, re-embarked
with the first battalion of the Fortieth regiment, and arrived
in England in November 1799.</p>

<p>In April 1800 Captain Reynell embarked with his regiment
for the Mediterranean, and went in the first instance
to Minorca, afterwards to Leghorn; returned to Minorca,
and proceeded with a large force under Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, for the attack of Cadiz. Signals for disembarking
were made; but although the boats had actually
put off from the ships, a recall was ordered, in consequence
of the plague raging at Cadiz. After this, he proceeded up
the Mediterranean again, and in November landed at Malta.
The flank companies of the Fortieth regiment having
been allowed to volunteer their services in the expedition to
Egypt, Captain Reynell proceeded thither in command of
the light company (one of the four flank companies detached
under Colonel Brent Spencer), and was present in the
action at the landing on the 8th of March 1801. On this
occasion the flank companies of the Fortieth were on the
right of the line, and were particularly noticed for the
gallant style in which they mounted the sand-hills immediately
where they landed. Captain Reynell was present in
the battle of the 13th of March, and commanded the right
out-piquet of the army in the morning of the 21st of that
month, when the French attacked the British near Alexandria,
on which occasion General Sir Ralph Abercromby
was mortally wounded. Soon after Captain Reynell proceeded
with a small British corps and some Turkish battalions
to Rosetta, of which easy possession was taken. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
present in the action at Rhamanie, on the 9th of May, and
followed the French to Grand Cairo, where that part of their
army capitulated, and returned as escort in charge of the
French troops to Rosetta; and after they had embarked
he joined the force under Major-General Sir Eyre Coote
before Alexandria. The surrender of Alexandria on the
2nd of September 1801 terminated the campaign, for his
services in which he received the gold medal conferred
by the Grand Seignior on the several officers employed.</p>

<p>Captain Reynell was afterwards appointed Aide-de-camp
to Major-General Cradock, who was ordered to proceed from
Egypt with a force of four thousand men to Corfu; but
while at sea counter-orders were received, and he proceeded
to Malta, and subsequently to England. In July
1804 he embarked as Aide-de-camp to Lieut.-General Sir
John Cradock, K.B., who had been appointed to the command
of the troops at Madras; and while on the passage,
namely, the 3rd of August 1804, he was promoted to the
rank of Major in the Fortieth regiment.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March 1805 Major Reynell received the
brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel upon being appointed
Deputy Quartermaster-General to the King’s troops in the
East Indies. In July following he was appointed Aide-de-camp
to the Marquis Cornwallis, Governor-General of India,
and accompanied his Lordship from Madras to Bengal, with
whom he remained until his Lordship’s decease at Ghazepore
in October 1805. Lieut.-Colonel Reynell returned to Madras
immediately afterwards, and was appointed Military Secretary
to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, the Commander-in-Chief
at that presidency. He officiated during
several months of the year 1806 as Deputy Adjutant-General
in India, in which country he remained until October 1807,
when he returned with Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock to
Europe, and arrived in England in April 1808.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Reynell resigned the appointment of
Deputy Quartermaster-General in India, and was brought
on full pay as Major of the Ninety-sixth regiment on the
5th of May 1808, and on the 22nd of September following
was appointed Major in the Seventy-first regiment.</p>

<p>In October 1808, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell embarked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
as Military Secretary to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock,
who had been appointed to command the forces in Portugal,
and landed in November at Lisbon. He remained in
Portugal until April 1809, when Sir John Cradock was
superseded in the command of the forces in Portugal by
Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley. Lieut.-Colonel Reynell
afterwards accompanied Lieut.-General Sir John
Cradock to Cadiz, Seville, and Gibraltar, of which latter
place Sir John Cradock was appointed Governor, and
Lieut.-Colonel Reynell remained there as Military Secretary
until September, when he returned to England.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Reynell joined the Seventy-first regiment
at Brabourne-Lees Barracks in December 1809, immediately
after its return from Walcheren. In September 1810 he
embarked at Deal with six companies of the Seventy-first
regiment for Portugal, landed at Lisbon towards the end of
that month, marched soon after to Mafra, and thence to
Sobral, where the six companies joined the army under
Lieut.-General Viscount Wellington. In October Lieut.-Colonel
Reynell had the honor of being particularly mentioned
by Viscount Wellington in his despatch, containing
an account of the repulse of the attack of the French at
Sobral on the 14th of that month. The British army
shortly afterwards retired to the lines of Torres Vedras, and
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell was appointed Assistant Adjutant-General
to the fourth division under Major-General the
Honorable George Lowry Cole.</p>

<p>Early in March 1811, the army of Marshal Massena broke
up from its entrenched position at Santarem, and retreated
to the northward. Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell entered
Santarem with the fourth division the day after Marshal
Massena had left it, and continued in the pursuit of the
French army to the Mondego. In the affair of Redinha he
had a horse killed under him. From Espinhal the fourth
division was ordered to retrograde, and recross the Tagus,
for the purpose of reinforcing Marshal Sir William Carr
Beresford. In 1811 he joined the Marshal at Portalegre,
and being the senior British assistant adjutant-general, was
directed to join Marshal Beresford’s head-quarters, and proceeded
with him to Campo Mayor, from which the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
retired; was also present at the capture of Olivença, and
subsequently accompanied the Marshal to Zafra, between
which place and Llerena a smart skirmish occurred with the
enemy’s hussars. In May 1811, Lieut.-Colonel Reynell
returned to England from Lisbon with despatches from
Viscount Wellington.</p>

<p>In July 1811, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Reynell embarked as
Military Secretary to Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, K.B.,
who had been appointed Governor and Commander of the
forces at the Cape of Good Hope, where he arrived by the
end of September. On the 4th of June 1813, he received
the brevet rank of Colonel; and on the 5th of August 1813,
he was promoted Lieut.-Colonel of the Seventy-first regiment,
in succession to Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable Henry
Cadogan, who was mortally wounded at the battle of Vittoria.
In February following, being desirous of joining the
corps, Colonel Reynell resigned his staff situation at the
Cape, and proceeded to England, where he arrived in
May 1814. In July of that year he was appointed Adjutant-General
to the force then preparing for service in America
under Lieut.-General Lord Hill; but, other operations being
then in view, that appointment was cancelled.</p>

<p>Colonel Reynell took the command of the first battalion
of the Seventy-first regiment at Limerick in December 1814,
and embarked with it from Cork in January of the following
year, as part of an expedition for North America; but
peace having been concluded with the United States, and
contrary winds having prevented the sailing of the vessels,
the destination of the battalion was changed. In March
Colonel Reynell received orders to proceed with his battalion
to the Downs, where, in the middle of April, it was trans-shipped
into small vessels, and sent immediately to Ostend,
to join the army forming in Flanders, in consequence of
Napoleon Bonaparte having returned from Elba to France.</p>

<p>In the memorable battle of Waterloo, fought on the 18th
of June 1815, Colonel Reynell commanded the first battalion
of the Seventy-first regiment, and was wounded in the foot
on that occasion. He afterwards succeeded to the command
of Major-General Adam’s brigade, consisting of the first
battalions of the Fifty-second and Seventy-first, with six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
companies of the second, and two companies of the third
battalion of the Ninety-fifth regiment, in consequence of that
officer being wounded. Colonel Reynell commanded the
light brigade in the several operations that took place on the
route to Paris, and entered that capital at the head of the
brigade on the 7th of July 1815, and encamped with it in
the <i>Champs Elysées</i>, being the only British troops quartered
within the barriers. In this year he was appointed a Companion
of the Order of the Bath, and received the Cross of
a Knight of the Austrian Military Order of Maria Theresa,
also a Cross of the fourth class of the Russian Military
Order of St. George.</p>

<p>Colonel Reynell remained with the “<i>Army of Occupation</i>”
in France until October 1818, when, after a grand review of
the united British, Danish, and Russian contingents at Valenciennes,
the Seventy-first marched to Calais, and embarked
for England. Colonel Reynell continued in command
of the regiment until the 12th of August 1819, the date of
his promotion to the rank of Major-General.</p>

<p>In April 1820 Major-General Reynell was suddenly ordered
to proceed to Glasgow, having been appointed to the staff of
North Britain as a Major-General, in which country he remained
until March 1821, when, in consequence of the
tranquillity of Scotland, the extra general officer was discontinued.
Immediately after he was appointed to the staff
of the East Indies, and directed to proceed to Bombay, for
which presidency he embarked in September following, and
where he arrived in March 1822. After remaining there a
month, Major-General Reynell was removed to the staff of
the Bengal Presidency, by order of the Marquis of Hastings.
In August Major-General Reynell proceeded up the Ganges,
and took the command of the Meerut division on the 3rd of
December 1822.</p>

<p>The next operation of importance in which Major-General
Reynell was engaged was the siege of <i>Bhurtpore</i>. Early in
December 1825 a large force had been assembled for this
purpose, to the command of which he had been appointed,
when, just as the troops were about to move into the Bhurtpore
states, General Lord Combermere, the new Commander-in-Chief
in India, arrived from England, and Major-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Reynell was then appointed to command the first division of
infantry. He commanded that division during the siege,
and directed the movements of the column of assault at the
north-east angle on the 18th of January 1826, when the
place was carried, and the citadel surrendered a few hours
after. For this service he was appointed a Knight Commander
of the Bath, as well as honored with the thanks of
both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Thomas Reynell succeeded to the
baronetcy upon the decease of his brother, Sir Richard
Littleton Reynell in September 1829; and on the 30th of January
1832 was appointed by His Majesty King William IV.
to be Colonel of the Ninety-ninth regiment, from which
he was removed to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> Royal Irish Fusiliers
on the 15th of August 1834. On the 10th of January 1837
he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General, and on
the 14th of June 1839 was appointed a member of the
Consolidated Board of General Officers, for the inspection
and regulation of the clothing of the army. On the 15th of
March 1841 he was appointed by Her Majesty to the Colonelcy
of the Seventy-first regiment. Lieut.-General Sir
Thomas Reynell, Bart., K.C.B., died at Avisford, near
Arundel, on the 10th of February 1848.</p>

<p class="p2 center" id="AP2"><i>Memoir of the Services of Lieut.-General Sir Charles William
Doyle, C.B., G.C.H., and K.C., formerly Lieut.-Colonel
of the</i> <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> <i>regiment</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This officer entered the army on the 28th of April 1783, as
Ensign in the One hundred and fifth regiment, which was
disbanded in the following year, and on the 12th of February
1793, was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in the
Fifty-ninth regiment, from which he was removed to the
Fourteenth foot on the 7th of March following, and to the
Ninety-first regiment on the 30th of October of the same
year. Lieutenant Doyle served with the Fourteenth regiment
until the beginning of 1794, in Holland and Brabant.
In the assault of the heights of Famars in 1793 he acted as
Brigade-Major to the brigade under Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, whose thanks he received upon the
field of battle for his conduct in storming the redoubts upon
the heights over Valenciennes. During the siege of that
city Lieutenant Doyle was employed as orderly officer in
attendance upon the Austrian generals. While on service
in the trenches he received a contusion in the head from the
splinter of a shell. The Fourteenth regiment having suffered
considerably, was left to garrison Courtray. He obtained
permission to join the army, and served the remainder
of the campaign as Aide-de-camp to Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, by whom he was sent to the Duke of
York with the account of the affair at Lannoi, in which he
received a contusion in the hand, and was again thanked
upon the field of battle by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby.
On the 21st of June 1794, Lieutenant Doyle was
promoted from the Ninety-first, in which he had acted as Adjutant,
to the Captain-Lieutenancy and Adjutancy of the
One hundred and eighth regiment; proceeded to Gibraltar,
where, upon that corps being drafted, he was appointed Aide-de-camp
to the governor of that fortress. On the 3rd of
September 1795, he was removed to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>,
as Captain-Lieutenant and Adjutant, and embarked in 1796
as Brigade-Major to the expedition against the Texel, under
his uncle Brigadier-General John Doyle. In that year
Captain Doyle proceeded to the West Indies in the same
capacity, but finding that his regiment was destined to
attack Porto Rico, he resigned his staff situation, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>, and received the thanks of Sir Ralph
Abercromby for his conduct in covering the retreat of the
army in April 1797, and was appointed his Aide-de-camp.
In 1798 he received the thanks of the Governor of Barbadoes,
for having driven off the coast a large French
privateer. Captain Doyle proceeded as Brigade-Major under
General Sir Ralph Abercromby with the expedition for the
attack of Cadiz in 1800; sailed from Minorca for the relief
of Genoa, and from Malta proceeded to Egypt, where he
served upon the staff of the army during the campaign. While
suffering from illness at Rosetta, in consequence of a wound
he had received in the battle of the 21st of March 1801, near
Alexandria, he obtained precise and important information
regarding the strength of the garrison and the state of the
works at Cairo, which led to the operations that resulted in
the surrender of the place without a shot being fired. For
this service he received the warm thanks of Lieut.-General
Hutchinson, who assumed the command upon the death of
General Abercromby, and also the approbation of His
Royal Highness the Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>In 1803 Captain Doyle returned from the Mediterranean,
was appointed Major of Brigade under Lieut.-General Sir
James Henry Craig, K.B., by whom he was employed, with
other staff officers, to make separate reports of the best mode
of defence of Hosely Bay; his plan was highly approved by
Sir James Craig, who recommended him to the Commander-in-Chief,
and he was promoted to the rank of Major of the
second battalion of the Sixty-first regiment, on the 9th of
July 1803. In the following year Major Doyle commanded
a corps composed of light infantry companies, and of regiments
of volunteers, formed for the defence of the northern
coasts of England by Lieut.-General Sir Hew Dalrymple,
whose warm thanks he received. At the close of 1804 he
was appointed by General Sir David Dundas, K.B., to
command a corps of light infantry at Barham Downs,
where he received the thanks of the Adjutant-General for
his system of light infantry practice, and about the same
time his Military Catechism was published. He was appointed
Assistant Quartermaster-General at Guernsey, and

<p>The rank of Major-General in the Spanish armies was
Conferred upon him, and a regiment was raised and named

the attack of the Col de Balaguer. A medal was struck by
the Spanish Government, specially to mark its approbation
of the conduct of the General, when he took by assault the
tower and battery of Bagur upon the 10th of September
1810, and assisted in the operations against, and the taking
the Castle of Palamos upon the 14th of September. The
motto, “<i>Spanish Gratitude to British Intrepidity</i>.” A
medal was presented to him at the close of the campaign.

<p>The honor of knighthood was conferred upon him by the
Prince Regent in 1812, and he was appointed a Companion
of the Order of the Bath for the important services rendered
by him in Spain. On the 30th, Lieut.-Colonel Sir Charles
Doyle was removed to the Eighty-fourth regiment, and was
placed on the half-pay of that corps on the 25th of February
1819, and on the 12th of August following was advanced to
the rank of Major-General. On the 1st of November 1819

of the Board assembled at the War Office to investigate
the services and pensions of soldiers. On Jan. 10.

<p class="p2 center" id="AP3"><i>Memoir of the Services of Lieut.-Colonel Matthew Shawe,
C.B., of the</i> <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span> <i>regiment</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Shawe was appointed an Ensign in the Twelfth foot on
the 7th of May 1799, and was promoted to the rank of
Lieutenant in the Seventy-fourth Highlanders on the 15th
of November 1801, with which regiment he served at the
storming and capture of the important fortress and town of
Ahmednuggur on the 8th and 12th of August 1803; was
wounded severely at the battle of Assaye on the 23rd of
September following, when the troops under Major-General
the Honorable Arthur Wellesley gained a victory over the
combined army of Scindiah and the Rajah of Berar. His
next service was at the battle of Argaum, on the 29th of
November; afterwards at the siege and storming of Gawilghur,
on the 15th of December 1803: this was a very
strong fort, situated on a range of mountains between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
sources of the rivers Poorna and Taptee. Lieutenant Shawe
served with the Seventy-fourth at the siege of Chandore, a
strong hill fort in Candeish. This place surrendered on the
12th of October 1804. Lieutenant Shawe was also at the
siege of Gaulnah in the same month; on the 30th of October
he was promoted to the rank of Captain in the Seventy-fourth
regiment.</p>

<p>Captain Shawe proceeded with his regiment to the Peninsula
<ins class="corr" id="tn-96" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'in Jauuary 1810'">
in January 1810</ins>; was present at the battle of Busaco
on the 27th of September following; also at the affairs of
Redinha on the 12th of March 1811, Condeixa on the day
following, Foz d’Aronce on the 15th of that month, Sabugal
on the 3rd of April, and at the battle of Fuentes d’Onor on
the 3rd and 5th of May 1811; in the latter action Captain
Shawe was wounded. He was advanced to the brevet rank
of Major on the 30th of May 1811, and served at the siege
and storming of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812; the siege
of Badajoz and the escalading of Fort Picurina on the 25th
of March. This fort was assaulted and carried by five hundred
men of the third division, two hundred of whom were
under Brevet-Major Shawe, who was dangerously wounded;
he however recovered, and received the brevet of Lieut.-Colonel,
which was dated the 27th of April 1812, for his
services on this occasion. He was also thanked in general
orders by Viscount Wellington for his conduct, received a
medal, and was subsequently nominated a Companion of the
Order of the Bath.</p>

<p>Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Shawe was appointed Major in the
Fifty-ninth regiment on the 4th of June 1813, and was promoted
Lieut.-Colonel in the Eighty-fourth regiment on the
15th of April 1817, and was removed to the <span class="smcap">Eighty-seventh</span>
regiment on the 30th of April 1818, the command
of which devolved upon him in May 1823 in consequence of
the decease of Lieut.-Colonel Miller. Lieut.-Colonel Shawe
died on the 10th of April 1826, on board His Majesty’s
sloop “<i>Slany</i>,” while within one day’s sail of Penang, where
he was buried with all military honors. His life was
sacrificed to his zeal for his duty, his health being such
that, on leaving Calcutta, his medical advisers tried every
argument to dissuade him from proceeding to join his regiment,
then employed in the Burmese territory.</p>
